Crushed it!
She got all of that one!
Look at it go!
Oh, crap.
You don't have to hit the snot out of it!
Go get the ball, Tsubaki!
Whoa!
So she struck yet again, huh?
- Bye!
- Bye!
Oh jeez! It's a corpse!
I better make a run for it...
Ow...Ouch...
Oh, it's you, Kousei. Thank goodness it's not someone else!
Huh? Tsubaki? When did you get here?
Whaaat? The window's broken! All I can see is red!
You broke it again? We just got this window fixed, you know!
A slugger is only as good as the number of windows she's broken.
You're blasting them too hard! Ease up a little!
No way am I batting with any less than my A-swing!
It's my last summer in middle school, okay? I'm gonna win the Triple Crown!
Anyway, gotta get this cleaned up.
Listen to me!
Dustpan...dustpan...
So I'm gonna have to apologize again? And write up the damage report...
Come on, that's dangerous!
What if you sliced a finger?
Well, what if I did?
Next-door neighbors, childhood friends...
you seek each other out whenever, wherever... Right, you loving hubby and wife?
We are not hubby and wife!
Anyway, what are you doing with that cell phone?
Aren't you in the middle of practice, Soccer Team?
Don't come in here with your shoes on, Watari!
That stupid bald vice principal.
Telling us off for an hour over a little broken glass?
Well, at least it only lasted an hour, right?
I was stuck with her for that hour. Put yourself in my shoes!
In the first place, the school shouldn't be standing right in the ball's path. No way!
Am I right?
I don't mind. Since the girls cheer me on from the windows sometimes.
Yeah, right!
Man, I'm starving.
So now it's food over sex, huh?
I'm gonna stop by the convenience store. Coming?
I'll go with you.
Me, too!
I mean, how messed up is that?
Why should I have to get yelled at, too?
Whoa!
This ice cream is delish! I'm gonna stock up!
Not listening...
Damn, Kousei, talk about collateral damage.
Not only did you get yelled at, but you have to write two letters of apology?
Oh, it's no big deal. Piece of cake!
I've been babysitting her since birth, so it's second nature to me now.
Busting a suspension bridge during a field trip...
Dumping me off a 10-meter diving board...
Was that back in third grade?
I thought I was gonna die.
Shut up!
Even though I'm an only child, it's like having a high-maintenance big sister.
You really are a nice guy, huh, Kousei?
You're kidding, right?
But Kousei, you'd better not be too nice.
You know what they say... nice guys are doomed to finish last.
Hey! I got a text from Keiko-chan!
I have somewhere to be, guys!
How many does that make?
She's No. 3.
Who knows what they all see in him? He's like Mr. Shallow!
But Watari's a good guy, you know.
He's the enemy of all women!
What about you, Kousei?
Huh?
Isn't there anyone you have a crush on?
What?
Miwa said something the other day.
That when you're in love with somebody, everything looks colorful...
There's no one who'd ever fall in love with me.
Too dark!
There's no sparkle in your eyes! We're fourteen, you know!
They don't sparkle because they're dark brown, obviously.
There it is! Conventional wisdom! You get my drift, don't you?
They don't sparkle! You're an adolescent, so they should be all lit up!
Lit up!
Yeah.
Your eyes are lit up, Tsubaki.
In Tsubaki's eyes, I'll bet everything around her looks colorful.
Unlike me...
When's your father coming home?
Mmm...in a month, or maybe two...
So you don't know yet.
Well, since it changes depending on the client's needs.
True...
If anything happens, your family will help out.
And besides, I'm used to being on my own now.
All right, see you tomorrow!
Okay! See you!
Hey!
Hello? Hey, my bad! I was gonna ask him today, but I forgot!
Okay, I'll do it for sure tomorrow. Hey, no worries.
If I ask him to... Yes. For sure.
So don't worry, okay?
I'm home...
Mother.
Miwa said something the other day.
"The moment I met him,
my life changed.
Everything I saw, everything I heard...
Everything I felt...
All the scenery around me started to take on color."
But... To me...
To me it all looks like it's in monotone.
Just like music scores... Just like a keyboard...
The autumn I was eleven... I...
Could no longer play the piano.
Leaving yourself WIDE open!
Jeez, what a boring reaction.
What does youth mean to you, anyway?
We'll never have our fourteenth spring again, you know!
Sitting alone in the classroom after school...
What are you listening to?
Hey, don't yank on those!
Hey, is this The Millions' new song?
The one that's playing on that commercial now? Whoa!
Oh, back off...
Kousei, tomorrow's Saturday, so you're free, right?
Don't just jump to conclusions!
Oh, so you have plans, then?
See, this girl in my class asked me to introduce her to Watari.
And we're gonna meet up tomorrow.
You come, too, Kousei.
Huh? Why would I go?
Well, if it's just me, this girl, and Watari, it's gonna be awkward for me.
Because you know it's gonna get romantic as heck.
But two on two would be perfect.
And besides...
I hear this girl plays classical music.
Since you play piano, Kousei, you'd have something to talk about,
which would be a big help, see?
Whenever the conversation lags, you could talk about instruments and stuff, right?
But I...
I quit playing the piano. I haven't played in two years.
You liar! You were playing  yesterday in the music room!
That was for work!
Work?
I'm transcribing the new songs by ear.
For karaoke and stuff.
If you can do that in the classroom, you wouldn't have to play the piano.
I was just checking the sound.
There are tons of other part-time jobs out there, you know.
To me...
It looks like you're desperately clinging onto it.
You were way cooler when you played the piano, Kousei.
It was my mother's dream...
To raise me to become a world-class pianist.
My mother ran a music school, and I took lessons from her
day after day, for hours on end...
She would hit me... yell at me...
She wouldn't let me off even if I cried.
You're going to make it big in Europe, in my place.
If it'll make you happy, Mother... If it'll make you get well...
Then I'll keep at it.
Just when I finally had a European competition in my sights, three years ago...
My mother passed away.
I hate the piano.
But if I'm still clinging to it,
it must be because I have nothing else.
Take away the piano, and I'm empty...
There's nothing left but an ugly resonance.
Can't hear it today, either...
They're late.
They should've been here five minutes early.
They're the ones who asked me to come... Huh?
To mark the spot? To ward off evil spirits?
These are women's, right?
Huh? What's this?
S-Spats? Huh? Huh?
A melodica? Pretty good playing, too.
Miwa said something the other day.
"The moment I met him, my life changed.
Everything I saw, everything I heard...
Everything I felt...
All the scenery around me started to take on color.
The whole world began to sparkle."
Tears...
I blew on it too hard...
Onee-chan...
No pigeons came!
Huh? That's weird.
It's gotta be a bugle, or it won't work.
You mean a trumpet.
Well, but it's a melodica.
Borders, race, ecology... none of them mean anything in music.
Let's all try it together!
Let's do it!
What a great picture they make...
They're the Bremen Town Musicians!
Here are the pigeons!
It's the first spring storm!
My hat!
Hey, you!
You moron! You've ruined my chances for marriage!
I-I'm sorry! But this was just a miraculous coincidence...
Hey! My leggings!
Why, you!
D-Don't use instruments as weapons!
You camera voyeur! You won't get away with this! You pervert!
What part of "coincidence" don't you get?
Who would ever target you...
My melodica...
You're so full of it!
What the...?
My recorder...
What the...?
Hey, I don't see them. You think they're waiting in the wrong spot?
Listen, Tsubaki, is this girl really that cute?
Girls calling other girls "cute"... not exactly credible, you know.
Aha! Kao-chan!
Hey, Kao-chan!
Tsubaki-chan!
Uh, let's take it from the top. This here...
...is my classmate, Kaori Miyazono.
Nice to meet you!
And...
This is Ryota Watari. He may not look it, but he's the captain of the soccer team.
Nice to meet you.
She's totally sweet! Good job, Tsubaki!
It's a real pleasure.
Pleasure!
Can you believe that instant about-face?
I'm ashamed of myself for being transfixed.
Oh, and not that it really matters,
but this is Friend A.
Oh!
Please excuse my earlier behavior.
One word out of you, and you're dead, Camera Voyeur!
She looks like Hell itself...
Wow, so polite.
Oh, please! Not at all!
Yo, Kousei...
Beating him to the punch by approaching her first...
My, my, aren't you the player?
I'm telling you, it was a miraculous coincidence!
What are you so pissed about?
But you're out of luck!
Kao-chan likes Watari.
Today, you're in a supporting role.
You're just Friend A, serving as Watari's foil. Give it up!
Who'd want a vicious girl like...
Hey!
I'm gonna be up soon! I've got to head over right now!
Head over? Where?
There.
Isn't that...
Towa Hall.
I'll be performing there today.
I'm a violinist.
A violinist? That's awesome!
Isn't it?
Let's go, Kousei.
I... I'm gonna pass...
You come with us, too!
The spring of my fourteenth year...
I...
Episode 1 Monotone/Colorful
I'm taking off with you.
Episode 2 Friend A
What time does the competition start?
Uh...the doors open at 3:00... and the thing starts at 3:30.
It's 3:20 now!
Crap! It's just about to start!
No worries, no worries.
I'm fourth anyway.
Huh?
That's cutting it close!
Main Hall - Information
We're here! Just made it!
I got us programs.
Hey, thanks.
No. 11 was last year's Honorable Mention, huh?
What about the Audience Award?
I wonder if she'll be able to play well?
That Mr. Kazama's leading the judging panel, huh?
It's a good chance to catch his eye.
You know what, it's like a different dimension in here. Everyone here's like a celebrity.
This tension before the competition starts is the same everywhere, huh?
Even I'm starting to get nervous!
You're not even competing, Tsubaki.
Bye.
Since I'm going this way.
Good luck!
We'll be rooting for you, okay?
Okay! I'll do my best!
The auditorium's this way, huh?
Right.
What's wrong?
N-No...
It's nothing.
This is your workplace.
Towa Music Competition Committee Sponsor Second Annual Towa Music Competition Violin - Middle School Division
Huh. It's smaller inside than I thought.
Don't compare it to a stadium!
I haven't felt this kind of atmosphere in a while...  since sixth grade, when I came to cheer you on.
The dry air... the smell of dust...
Those seats over there are open.
Hey, isn't that Arima?
It's Arima-kun.
Arima... you mean that pianist?
He's all grown up now.
You mean the youngest kid to ever win the Saiki Competition?
But I thought he was overseas?
What's he doing at the Violin Competition?
Heyyy...
Ex-celebrity!
The classical world sure is small!
Hey, you kept this from me on purpose, didn't you?
That we'd be going to hear her perform!
Because...
If you knew about that, Kousei... You wouldn't have come, would you?
So I kept it on the down-low with all my might.
So the piano only makes you feel lousy, then?
Towa Music Competition Committee Sponsor Second Annual Towa Music Competition Violin - Middle School Division
We will now begin the preliminary round of the Towa Music Competition
Violin Section for Middle-schoolers.
Beethoven... Violin Sonata No. 9.
The Kreutzer.
Huh? He's asleep already?
It's been a while since I heard a live performance.
What can I say...
I'm really starting to get goosebumps.
It's the same song over and over. Boring!
Well, that's the set piece. And you're the one who brought me here.
But it's a pretty big turnout, huh? I'm a little surprised.
This is a newly-established major national competition that's starting to get some notice.
The sponsors are kinda quirky.
Normally, the set piece for the preliminary round  would be Bach or Paganini numbers, played solo,
Towa Hall
but in this contest, every number features an accompanist. That's pretty rare.
The winner gets the right to play on a Guarneri owned by the sponsors in a recital.
Guar...neri? Kabanini?
He's off.
Is it just me or does he stink?
You got this.
You got this!
Kazuhiro Oyama Umena Middle School
Well, that was too bad. And he started off so well, too.
He made two or three mistakes.
Is he one of Mr. Sato's students?
No wonder, then.
Midway through, he started flailing with his bow. Guess he panicked.
Head Judge
Still, what consistency. That was raw, but the overall level was high. He played it well.
You're absolutely right, Mr. Kazama!
Well, it got interesting after he messed up. At this rate I'm going to fall asleep.
Now, then, who's next?
Hey! Kao-chan's up next!
Hey, wake up, Watari!
Oh, crap, I messed up...
- Kao-chan looks so pretty!
- I've been waiting for this, yo!
This is making me nervous.
My music...
Will it reach them?
Elohim, Essaim... Elohim, Essaim... I implore you...
So cute!
Is this...
This is the same song, right?
No question, it's the set piece, the Kreutzer.
But...
This is blasphemy! Both the tempo and the dynamics are all over the place!
She's even ignoring the pianist and going off on her own!
She might as well be picking a fight with the composer!
It's the Kreutzer... but this piece is no longer Beethoven's.
This piece...
There's no denying that she owns it.
She's ultra-violent, her personality blows, and she leaves the worst impression.
But...
She's beautiful.
Kao-chan, you're gorgeous!
Kaori-chan, you're the best!
Aha, now that was stunning.
An overwhelming personality, refusing to blindly obey the composer.
Though I'm sure it's not Mr. Kazama's cup of tea...
During a serious competition!
What she has is on a whole different level.
Kaori Miyazono Sumitani Junior Highschool [Piano: Satomi Sakakibara] Previous Awards: None
How on earth is this girl not famous?
This is amazing. They're still buzzing about her. It's like a concert venue! You think she'll win?
What? Uh...
But what a shame. What a crying shame.
This is a competition, after all.
There's no way she'll win or even place. Too many deductions.
Not playing the way the score's written is a total taboo.
But why? You saw how everyone loved it!
I could see it if this were a recital, but no way in a competition.
But... I'm sure... That's probably not what she's seeking.
I wonder how she can seem so happy while she's performing?
We will now take a fifteen-minute break.
That No. 4 was totally awesome, huh?
Is what she did allowed?
You mean Kaori Miyazono, right?
I even know her name now!
I think I'm a fan!
Talk about a huge impact!
She's so cute.
Amazing! They're all talking about Kao-chan. Well, she was really cool, wasn't she?
Wasn't it like we were at a concert? She was the only one I could stay awake for.
It was beyond lame of you to snooze from the get-go.
Well, I couldn't help it!
Uh... um...
U-Um... Here...
Flowers for you...
We were so moved!
Wow, they're so pretty! Thanks!
Oh, Ms. Miyazono. We'll be posting the result  thirty minutes after the panel's done.
Oh, don't mind me.
Because I really don't care about that stuff.
It means nothing unless you come in first.
Kao-chan!
Tsubaki-chan!
Bye now. Thanks for the flowers!
Sure!
The violinist who just finished performing...
Comes running towards those who await her.
Weaving through the crowd...
Flowers in her arms...
It's just like...
...a scene out of a movie...
That was awesome! You were so cute!
Thanks!
It was incredible.
Hey, Friend A!
Oh, one sec.
Sure.
Hey!
What did you think?
Huh? M-Me?
Wasn't I amazing?
Uh... See...
What... did you... think?
Uh... Um... Not bad...
I've never seen anyone get flowers after the prelims.
Not only that, but you don't even know them, right?
They couldn't have known to bring them, so for those girls...
hearing your performance, then rushing out to buy flowers to give to you...
It must've been an unforgettable day.
I think it was that kind of performance.
How do you like that?
It's just like...
...a scene out of a movie.
Although I only played Friend A.
We will now be announcing the names of the contestants who cleared the preliminaries.
All right! I see my name!
Huh? No. 8 didn't make it?
There's my name!
I'm gonna take a picture.
Passed First Preliminaries
Chie-chan, I see your name. Hey...
Audience Choice: Kaori Miyazono
The Audience Award winner makes it to the second round, too.
Music Preparation Room
Huh? Watari?
Man, you gave me a heart attack.
You weren't in the nurse's office, so I came to find you,
and you're passed out on the floor! I thought you were dead!
Arima?
Use this to ice the spot where you got clobbered.
Thanks.
So? What were you up to, ditching class and screaming bloody murder?
Nothing... I was just clearing my mind.
Well, you're acting pretty strange today. Even more spaced out than usual.
Hey! Could it be that you... You were thinking about a girl you like, right?
Wh-Where did that come from?
That pretty much defines the idle thoughts of adolescence, man.
Was it the timely Kaori-chan? Hey, I get it. She was so darned cute, huh?
Never in a million years and you know it! Besides...
She's...
You're in a supporting role. Kao-chan...
She likes you, Watari.
No way would she ever like me.
But that doesn't make any difference.
It's only natural for the girl you're crushing on to be in love with someone else.
Since you're in love with her,
she sparkles in your eyes.
That's why people fall so irrationally in love.
I think I kind of get why you're such a chick-magnet, Watari.
You bet. There are plenty of girls that I like!
But for me, it's impossible.
I'm sure...
Whether or not it's impossible,
the girl will let you know.
You give good advice, Watari.
Don't I though?
Hey, you! Watari!
You made Keiko cry again, didn't you?
C-Calm down!
What do you mean, calm down?
I was gonna ditch practice today and go home with Keiko-chan!
Seeing as I've neglected her for a while.
You're awful, after all.
Watari's right.
I'm not myself today. I'm out of here...
Before I know it...
Against a screen of bright red clouds...
I hear the refrain against the black curtain of my closed eyes.
Over and over... Again and again...
Again and again...
And every time, my heart...
It's like what my mother left me scatters away...
I want to hear it again, yet I don't want to hear it again...
One more time...
I want to see her,
yet I don't want to see her.
This kind of feeling...
What was it called again?
What do you call this kind of feeling again?
Friend A.
You exist inside spring.
She's wearing our school uniform. So you really are a student here.
Wh-What are you staring at?
You were gonna sneak another shot, weren't you? Pervert!
I would never, and I didn't!
Liar! You're gonna spread it all over the internet!
I won't, I won't!
Oh, never mind. It'll only make my popularity explode anyway.
Talk about over-confident...
Anyway, where's Watari-kun?
Watari?
I want to scare him, so I'm lying in wait.
I was gonna ditch practice today and go home with Keiko-chan!
Think he'll be here soon?
Nah, no sign of him showing up at all.
Watari's...
He's still in practice.
I think!
I see.
Then maybe I'll go take a peek at the soccer team.
Huh?
They've got their summer tournament coming up, see!
I don't know if you should barge in on practice...
Yeah! Right! I don't think it's a good idea!
Watari's quite nervous about it...
Hmm, you do have a point.
If I disrupt him, he'll hate me, huh?
I'm appointing you as his substitute!
Friend A
Huh?
Episode 3 Inside Spring
Caramel Waffles with  Apples and Nuts
Thanks for waiting!
Here are your caramel waffles with apples and nuts!
Wow! I've always wanted to try this!
Oh, boy! This is amazing! Hey, where...
...do you think I should start?
Huh?
Where should I start?
Hmm...
Should I take a picture?
First I was an extra... now I'm a substitute, huh?
Okay! That's all she wrote!
Is baking sweets your hobby or something?
No, no... I don't make them.
So...good!
She's such an amazing musician, but all she looks like now is an ordinary girl.
Hey... I thought it was just a prop,  but you can really play it, huh?
That piano... is such a happy piano...
That piano's grinning from ear to ear!
It's a sad little piano, you know.
You should never put a piano near water, but they've decorated it with fresh flowers.
I learned it in piano class!
Megu-chan, that's awesome!
Oh? That's Mozart, huh?
I learned this the other day. But I still can't play it well.
Is that right? Well, it is pretty hard, huh?
Onee-chan, can you play the piano?
She sure knows how to get along with kids. I guess her mental age is low?
No. But...
that Onii-chan over there  is an unbelievable pianist,
so why don't we ask him to teach us?
For real?
Play for us!
Show me how!
No, I... I don't play piano anymore...
Ouch!
Don't embarrass me in front of those children!
Okay... just a little, then.
Yay!
Three, two...
See, what did I tell you? It's a happy piano, after all!
Huh? Why are you stopping?
You can't stop playing!
You were so cool!
Sorry... I'm really... sorry...
Thank you very much!
Oh, boy, I'm stuffed!
I am one satisfied girl!
Huh?
It's a kitty!
You like cats?
I used to have a black cat just like this one.
You did?
So you're not gonna play the piano anymore?
You know about that.
Winner of the Moriwaki Students' Piano Competition...
The youngest winner in history of the Saiki Competition.
And so on...
Your playing style was accurate and disciplined - a human metronome.
You were a prodigy who performed with an orchestra at eight.
You've done your homework.
It's common knowledge. There isn't a musician of our generation who hasn't heard of you.
Since you're who we look up to.
Why did you quit playing?
Why?
I can't hear the sound of the piano.
How cliche is that, right?
But you were just playing at that cafe, weren't you?
Sure, I can hear it at first.
But... somewhere along the way...
The more I concentrate... the more I get consumed by my performance...
The sounds I play...
fade away from my reach, tangling up like flowers seized by the spring wind...
...and vanish.
So that's why, just now...
It doesn't affect me at all in my daily life.
It's only the sound of my own playing that I can't hear.
It's a punishment...
Even though I can hear the sounds of my fingers striking the keys,
and the sounds of the keys sinking...
the only thing I can't hear is the sound of my own playing.
This has to be... a punishment.
Don't be such a baby!
Wh-What...
You're so negative! Play even if you can't play!
Have you tried playing with a stick between your teeth, like Beethoven?
If you can't move your hands, then play with your feet!
That's crazy...
If you don't have enough fingers, then use your nose as well!
Mozart?
Whether you're sad, you're a mess,
or you've hit rock bottom, you still have to play!
That's how people like us survive.
People like us...
Yeah, maybe that's true for you.
Since you're in love with her, she sparkles in your eyes.
When I'm with you, what Watari said  kind of makes sense to me.
You're in love with food,
you're in love with the violin, you're in love with music.
I guess that's why you sparkle?
What do you call this kind of feeling again? This is probably...
This is probably what you call yearning, I bet.
I've made up my mind.
I'm appointing you as my accompanist.
Whaaat?
Since I won the Audience Award,  I'll be playing in the second round.
My accompanist for that.
Huh? Did you hear a word I said?
I can't play, all right? I can't hear what I'm playing.
Quit your whining. My mind's made up. Just give in to your fate like a good boy.
You exist inside spring.
You exist inside a spring that can't be replaced.
I hereby appoint Friend A as my accompanist.
Morning, Tsubaki!
Morning!
Come back here, you!
I said I just can't do it, all right?
Just shut up and be my accompanist!
What the heck?
Ambushing me at this hour!
For our set piece,
I decided on Saint-Saens's Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso,
so I'll bring you the sheet music tomorrow.
Home Economics Room
Have Kousei play the accompaniment for your violin?
I got dumped by my accompanist from the other day...
That guy's insanely good on the piano, right?
You knew about that, Kao-chan?
Well, to anyone who plays music, he's a total celebrity.
That's why I thought I'd ask him.
You don't think... he'll do it?
I'm totally psyched!
Did I just feel a chill?
Like I could eat that.
Huh? Classical music?
I thought they always played pop.
Saint-Saens's Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso?
Not only that, but it's on repeat...
What the...?
Tsubaki   Kaori
Accompaniment, accompaniment, accompaniment, accompaniment...
All right, open up your textbooks to page 17.
What the heck is going on today?
Huh?
I know it's you, Tsubaki!
When did she do this? Even my wallpaper's...
Play the accompaniment!
Play the accompaniment!
Classical again?
They've been playing this same song for a week now!
I just can't do it...
It's tomorrow, huh?
I wonder if it'll be nice out?
The way he's been acting, Kousei will bail for sure.
I'm gonna drag him there no matter what.
But are you sure it's really okay? To force him to accompany me?
It's fine, it's fine. With Kousei, you have to be at least this pushy.
It's a good idea! A good idea!
Hey, I'm gonna make Watari help, too. If it's for a girl...
If it's for you, Kao-chan, no way will he say no.
I'm so going to make you play the piano!
You really like Arima-kun, don't you, Tsubaki-chan?
Well...
It's not quite like that. To me...
Kousei is...
Even though I'm an only child, it's like having a high-maintenance big sister.
He's like a hopeless kid brother...
To be honest, it doesn't matter to me whether Kousei plays the piano or not.
The thing is, though...
If he's gonna quit, I want him to quit on his own terms. It hurts to see him like this.
Because right now, Kousei's only living his life halfway.
Ever since that day...
Ever since that day, Kousei's been trapped with nowhere to go.
Time just stops, doesn't it?
So I want him to play the piano... Because I'm sure something will change if he does...
Next stop,

Stop Requested
We'll be making the next stop.
We will now commence judging the second round of preliminaries for the Violin Competition.

Wh-What...
...are you doing at school?
Isn't this the day of the prelims?
What do you think you're doing?
I came to pick you up!
Hiding out in a place like this! I looked all over for you, so let's get going!
But I've been telling you all this time, I'm not gonna accompany you!
What's that?
I mean, there are people who train to specialize in that. No way could I ever do it!
And besides, even if we headed over right now,
I couldn't give a performance that I could live with...
I can't play the piano.
Once again, I'm casting about for a reason.
So what are you saying?
It's not that you can't play. You just won't play.
"I can't hear the sound of the piano..."
You're just using that as your excuse to run away.
I...
I... I'm afraid.
It's like I'm at the bottom of a dark sea where I can't hear anything.
There's no one here...
So dark... So dark...
Weren't you relieved the moment you stopped being able to hear?
You found yourself an excuse. An excuse not to ever appear onstage again.
After all, you're no Beethoven!
Help me...
I can't hear anything!
Did his mind just go blank?
Why isn't he playing?
Did he forget how to play?
Weird kid.
I've never seen this happen before.
Someone...
Arima's self-destructed!
It's over.
Lucky break!
That's one less competitor.
...help...
This is the frontrunner?
He cracked under the pressure.
Mom...
I'm going to be alone again at the bottom of a dark sea.
But you have me.
I know that can't hear the sound of your playing, and that you haven't been playing.
I know everything. But I want you.
Just like you said, we might not be able to turn in a performance that we can live with.
But we're going to play. As long as I have a chance to play,
and there's an audience that will listen.
Kousei!
Kousei!
I'm going to play with everything I've got.
So that the people who've heard me will never forget me.
So that I can live in their hearts forever.
That's my reason for existing.
I'm a musician, after all! Just like you.
So... I'm asking you to do this for me.
Please be my accompanist.
Huh? What? Um...
A tiny bit will do... Please give me your support.
Please support me in this moment that I'm about to lose heart.
Watari was totally right.
Whether or not it's impossible...
The girl will let you know.
I'll do it. I'll be your accompanist.
I'm not making any guarantees, all right?
Found you!
What are you doing? We've been looking for you!
Don't you dare run away! Not if you call yourself a man!
If we make a run for it, we'll be there in 20 minutes!
20 minutes? I won't be able to play decently!
Hey, I've got an idea.
Let's go!
But will you be okay? What about practice? Have you rehearsed together?
No worries! We'll figure it out! Because we rule!
Don't underestimate us jocks! I can make you time to rehearse!
Wait, shouldn't you guys be in school? And whose bike is this?
Hey, don't sweat the small stuff!
The town that I live in... is starting to take on color...

Watch Again Next Week!
Two People on a Bike is Forbidden By Law
Listen to me, Kousei,
I want you to study the sheet music over and over,
and play it again and again and again.
That's how you're going to perfect it.
Just what the score calls for,
just as the composer intended,
perfectly and precisely.
You're off again! How many times do I have to tell you?
You're not going to bed until you can play that passage!
Take a good look at it! It's all there in the sheet music!
Arima's No. 1 again? Well, his mother is a direct disciple of Mr. Hashimoto.
I bet there's sheet music  plastered onto those glasses!
Plus they'll hide the bruises from when she hits him.
He practices seven or eight hours a day, right? Everyday!
When does he get to play?
Most people couldn't stand a life like that.
He really is just like a machine.
None of them know what they're talking about.
I'm the only one who's on Mom's side.
Go!
But will you be okay? What about practice? Have you rehearsed together?
No worries! We'll figure it out! Because we rule!
Don't underestimate us jocks! I can make you time to rehearse!
Wait, shouldn't you guys be in school? And whose bike is this?
Hey, don't sweat the small stuff!
Just barely, but...
Safe!
Kousei!
We're here!
We made it!
Let's do this!
Thank you both! We'll be going, then!
Kousei, your shoes! Sneakers aren't gonna cut it!
Put mine on!
Hurry! Hurry!
Better than sneakers, at least!
Tsubaki... Watari...
Thanks. I'll be going now.
Get out of here, moron!
Come on! We're cutting it close. Run!
Slow down a little...
Move!
You think Kousei can pull this off?
Spring will be here soon.
Huh? It's almost May, when the cherry blossoms scatter.
Yeah. But... I just know...
...that spring will come.
Towa Music Competition Committee Sponsor Second Annual Towa Music Competition Violin - Middle School Divison
Next, No. 12, Nashida. Please get ready.
All right! Your goal is to go out on top!
Y-Yes, ma'am! I'm gonna try to go out on top... I-I'll do my best!
Oh, man, that's putting the pressure on...
This is beyond crazy. I should have spent a lot of time practicing this,
memorizing it with my whole body,
fine-tuning it to the point where I don't need the sheet music anymore...
But I'll practically be sight-reading when I coordinate the piece with her.
And on top of that, such a...
Such an insanely out-of-control violinist!
All set!
What tempo should we use? Take-no-prisoners, maybe?
This is crazy, it's reckless!
No way can I turn in a decent performance like this.
Do I look good in this dress?
It's brand-new.
If I just man up and back out of this, it won't sting as much.
We're only gonna humiliate ourselves,  going out like this.
Ignoring me?
Whaaaat?
So tell me, did that calm you down?
What's the big idea, all of a sudden?
Look at me.
Look up, and look at me.
You're always looking down.
That's why you're imprisoned inside that cage of music scores.
Don't worry, I know you can do it.
You were listening to it all during lunch break, right?
The sheet music was always somewhere in view, right?
I know you and I can do it.
Mozart's telling us from up in the sky... "Go on a journey," he's saying.
"A man away from home need feel no shame."
Let's go out there and shame ourselves like crazy!
Together...
No. 14, Ms. Kaori Miyazono,
please get ready to go on.
Let's go!
Are you listening, Kousei?
Just what the score calls for... It's all there in the sheet music.
Naive... Bizarre...
It's like I'm on a rollercoaster. I'm being jerked around and around.
It's like this girl herself is the journey with no clear destination.
You're freedom itself.
No, I'm not.
Music is freedom.
This silence belongs to us. Every single person here...
...is waiting for us to start producing sounds.
Come on, let's go on a journey.
Saint-Saens is waiting for us!
Here they are!
My Kaori-chan!
Hey, the accompanist is a kid, too.
Huh?
Wait, could that be...
I've been waiting for you, Kaori Miyazono... Hmm?
She's got a different accompanist. A kid, at that.
What are you doing?
I can't set my chair just right.
Hurry it up, you slowpoke. Adjust it with both hands!
He somehow looks familiar...
It's Arima. The pianist.
Arima-kun?
I see. So that kid's Kousei Arima, huh?
That's right. He's grown up since then, but that's the face of the pianist, Arima...
Kousei Arima.
So they know each other? Actually, why is he accompanying her?
Finally got it right.
Jeez!
Huh. Synthetic and all-natural. Talk about a mismatched couple!
What kind of performance do you have planned?
Elohim, Essaim... Elohim, Essaim... I implore you...
Your face is totally frozen.
A song dedicated to the virtuoso violinist, Sarasate.
Saint-Saens's Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso.
All right, that was a good start. I can hear the notes, too.
I'm glad we're doing this song.
There are some parts where I could go off-key,
but if I listen closely to the violin, and keep an eye on the sheet music...
Technically, it's not a difficult song.
Ah... Kousei's playing the piano again...
Kaori Miyazono... In a complete departure from her previous performance,
she's being docile here.
Out of consideration for Arima, maybe?
And now she's showing her true colors!
Awesome!
The notes...
They're vanishing...
The sound of the piano...
I can't hear it!
Huh? What's going on?
Huh? The accompanist...
The sound is out of sync.
Kousei!
The accompanist who never played a false note,
who played with such stunning precision...
...is starting to unravel.
As if I'm at the bottom of a  dark sea, I can't hear anything.
There's no one here. It's dark.. It's dark...
It's dark. I'm at the bottom of a dark sea...
...and I'm going to be all alone.
He's pounding on the keys, but this isn't the accompaniment, is it?
This accompanist blows.
Too bad, I did like the violin.
In spite of your inexperience, you were holding your own till now.
What got into you all of a sudden, Arima?
The piano is destroying this performance!
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
I'm pounding the keys so hard...
So why?
Why is it that the only thing I can't hear is my own playing?
Probably a smart move. A deduction's inevitable,
but if he keeps on playing, it could affect the violinist.
Lousy piano playing!
Don't mess it up for her!
You shouldn't have been playing from the start!
Sorry... If I keep playing like this...
If I play... I'll only make trouble for you.
No way! Now even the violinist's stopped playing!
Does this mean they're disqualified?
Well, not disqualified, but...
This is unheard of!
It's over for them.
Why did she stop?
There's no reason for her to accommodate that awful accompanist...
And she was so cool...
Don't worry.
I know you and I can do it.
I hereby appoint you as my accompanist.
You still have to play!
But I want you.
I'm going to play with everything I've got.
So that the people who've heard me... ...will never forget me.
I'm a musician, after all!
Again.
Maybe there's only a dark road up ahead.
But you still have to believe and keeping going.
Believe that the stars will light your path, even a little bit.
Come on...
Let's go on a journey!
Are they allowed to start over?
It's allowed as long as it's within the time limit,
but nothing after they stopped will count.
This competition is over for that girl now.
Then...
...what exactly is she playing for?
What are you doing, Kousei? Are you gonna make Kaori-chan play by herself?
Kousei...
For you...
For you... I'm casting about for an excuse again.
I know you and I can do it.
There was resolve in your eyes.
So what was it that you saw in me?
But you have me.
Look up, and look at me.
Look at me...
Brace yourself...
Now we're talking!
Kousei!
He started playing.
But they still sound out of sync.
What are you going to do, Arima?
Focus... Focus...
Focus!
Both the sound and the notes are disappearing like nobody's business.
All week long, the sheet music was always where I could see it.
All during my lunch breaks, I listened to it.
Whatever I have inside of me... Draw it out!
Focus, focus... focus...
Focus!
Are you listening, Kousei?
You mustn't play so violently.
The piano is you.
If you touch it gently, it will smile.
If you pound it with force, it will become enraged.
Touch it like you're caressing a baby's head.
All right, again.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star... How I wonder what you are...
Up above the world so high... Like a diamond in the sky...
Twinkle, twinkle, little star... How I wonder what you are.
If you can't hear the sound,
then imagine it!
Play it with your whole body!
Draw out what Mom left me!
Hey, come on, Friend A...
Don't you dare try to steal my thunder!
Are you kidding me?
Wow, Kousei! Kao-chan! You're amazing!
She's beautiful.
Well, this is outrageous. They're both out of control. It's like a brawl.
And the audience is entranced by this brawl.
Of course he's not used to this. He's not an accompanist.
He's a soloist, just like her.
She moves me. With such power,
like the pounding of my heart.
I can hear your sound.
You're here.
April will be ending soon.
Bravo!
You were great, middle school duo!
That was awesome!
Encore!
During a serious competition!
The dry air-conditioning,
the scent of dust.
I...
I'm going on a journey.

Let's go!
Doryo Bridge
Feels so good!
Next!
Kousei! Go!
I don't think so...
You'll go if you're a man!
It's gonna change your whole world!
But I have a lesson... My mom's gonna yell at me...
Shoulder wheel backdrop!
Tsubaki?
Kousei?
Hey, he can't swim!
Kousei!
He came to!
Kousei!
Again! Again!
Aha! He's addicted now!
Kao-chan, we came to pay you a visit...
Kou         Tsubaki         Watari
The nape of her neck!
Ever heard of knocking?
Her skin's so fair!
Delete that memory!
Oh, wow, what a shock.
Now I can never be anyone's bride!
Totsuhara University Hospital
You really threw us a curve, getting hospitalized like this.
Well, my dad's so over-the-top.
I'm only here for routine testing, just to make sure.
Have you ever passed out like that before?
It's the first time.
I've always been a little anemic,
but this is a good chance to get thoroughly tested.
I guess I pushed myself a little too hard.
You know, all that violin practice,
not to mention chasing after Mr. Escape Artist... all week long!
The stress of not being able to rehearse together, and all...
That's right, that's right!
It's all your fault!
That's right, that's right!
Kaori and I didn't make it to the next round.
Unprecedented. One mishap after another.  A no-brainer for disqualification.
Ineligible. Performance interrupted. The worst possible scenario. All my fault.
You haven't said a word of reproach.
Hey, let's get going.
We shouldn't outstay our welcome.
Whaaat? I'm gonna spend the night!
Okay, Kao-chan, see you at school!
Come on!
Bye!
I'm staying over!
No, you aren't!
Hey...
Have you been playing the piano?
It would be so much easier if she just chewed me out.
No. I haven't been playing.
Why not?
It's like... I have nothing to offer but my piano playing...
Is that a bad thing?
Do you think you'll be able to forget?
Gray skies.
Totsuhara University Hospital
Looks like rain, huh?
Hurry up, hurry up! What, you're not there?
What were you talking about with Kao-chan?
Huh? Oh, not anything major...
Then you shouldn't mind telling me!
Keiko-chan?
It's me, Ryo-chin. Yeah, yeah.  You busy right now?
Is playing the piano all I have to offer?
No, not at all. You have lots of good qualities, Kousei.
For example...
Oh, hey! Look at that! The sky!
A sunny spell.
Do you think you'll be able to forget?
Did you see me make the shot?!
You gave me a heart attack.
What's that?
I'm sending this to Kaori-chan.
Let's stop by the hospital tomorrow.
I hear she's getting discharged the day after.
Let's get her a present on the way.
So he already knows her email address...
I bet she'll get a kick out of that!
I'm gonna pass. You should go by yourself, Watari.
I'd feel awkward.
I'm the one who made a fiasco out of her competition.
And besides...
But...
You were the one she leaned on.
Kousei...
But that's only because I'm the one who can play the piano.
That's all there is to it.  No other reason.
Hey, I know. I know that, but still.
I know that but you'll never know.
Don't hold back because of me. Let's go together!
We might catch her naked again!
Watari! The captain shouldn't be slacking!
Just watch all the dazzling plays I make!
Someone's pretty pumped up.
You got that right!
Our final tournament's about to start!
And besides, after witnessing that spectacle, how can I not get all fired up?
The way you two were that day...
It's burned into my mind! I'll never forget it!
I'll never forget it!
Do you think you'll be able to forget?
The piano is just one part of you. But in that moment, without a doubt...
The piano was everything to you.
And you're trying to rip that away by force.
As if you were plucking off your limbs...
That's why it hurts too much for you to bear.
Your face says the suffering is so painful,  too painful to bear...
Do you think you'll be able to forget? 
No, not a chance!
Because you and I are living for that moment.
You were great, middle school duo!
Because you're a musician, just like me.
Good job, pianist!
Unprecedented. One mishap after another.
Even so,
the people here won't ever forget us.
I won't forget.
I won't forget, even if I die.
Thank you.
It's all thanks to you.
Because you accompanied me. Because you played the piano for me.
Thank you, Kousei Arima.
She's merciless.
That unbending gaze.
Even from the back,
she won't let me give up.
Please support me!
The one who was being supported...
...was me.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see... So I passed out again.
First... Oof!
Safe!
Lucky!
What the heck was that, Tsubaki?
Yay!
Little kids are so gung-ho!
I know, even though the water's so cold.
Yeah, but you used to dive from the "Courage Bridge" all the time.
Not to mention, always shoving Arima-kun off it...
Kousei!
That was no biggie!
Kousei always laughed it off himself.
I wouldn't call that "no biggie."
Sure it was.
I know it for a fact.
Did something happen between you and Arima-kun?
N-N-N-Not a thing! Don't say freaky things like that!
Nailed it...
Well, okay, then.
I mean, being upbeat is your only saving grace.
But yesterday and today, you kind of haven't been yourself. Tsubaki...
Your eyes are cloudy.
Hey!
If it isn't Kashiwagi and Tsubaki!
What a coincidence!
Yo, Saito-senpai!
Long time no see!
Hey, check out that uniform.
Now that's a high school student!
I haven't seen you since graduation.
You burning up the league as usual?
Oh, I'm on fire! How about you?
It's tough being a first year again. I'm nothing but a gofer.
And if they'd just let me play shortstop, I'd be the best, you know?
The former captain of our baseball team.
Totally hot, dependable, and the one all the girls dreamed about.
So unlike someone else I know.
A complete tool,
not to be depended on...
No one's idea of a dreamboat...
It's okay. It's okay.
I do know that Kousei has lots of good qualities besides playing the piano, after all!
Looks like rain, huh?
Cloudy weather.
Your eyes are cloudy.
It's okay. It's okay.
So why am I feeling so uneasy, then?
Hey, Tsubaki?
Yes?
This was no coincidence, see.
The former captain of our baseball team. Totally hot, dependable,
and the one all the girls dreamed about.
I dreamed about him, too.
But I was never able to tell him,
and my love melted away with the snow on graduation day, and it was over.
That's the kind of love I thought it was.
I'm happy. I'm so happy.
Look, I'm serious about this, okay?
And yet why... why isn't my heart sparkling, I wonder?
I bet if this was back around graduation,
my heart would've been sparkling like a starry sky in winter.
So she's out of the hospital.
All right.
Don't get the wrong idea.
She just needed an accompanist.
Hop, skip, jump! Hop, skip, jump!
As if you can see right through me, into my heart...
Hop, skip... hop, skip...
Always, out of nowhere, you...
Hop...
Skip...
...jump!
...just show up.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Isn't it obvious?
Playing hopscotch.
She said she was waiting for someone.
Yeah.
Shh! Shh!
There.
Why are you holding out your hand?
My gift for getting out of the hospital.  I'll take it now.
No gift?
That's horrible of you! Watari-kun gave me flowers!
And you're the one who made such a mess of my performance!
When I was gunning to win it all!
You liar!
Don't make women cry!
This is why men are so...!
All right, then! I'll do something for you, okay?
You'll do anything I ask?
Sure, sure.
No matter what?
No matter what.
Yippee!
I knew it...
Hmm, what should I ask for?
I know!
Enter a piano competition.
It's your turn now.
There's no way I can do that.
Why not? You were playing fine that day.
Are you still afraid?
There you go again, looking down!
We're all afraid, you know...  to get up onstage.
Maybe you'll mess up. Maybe they'll totally reject you.
Even so, you grit your teeth and get up onstage anyway.
Something compels us... moves us to play music.
Is it like that for you, too?
Everything you say and do... it all sparkles so brightly.
It's too blinding for me, and I end up closing my eyes.
I'm a guy...
...who hurled my precious sheet music away.
I don't deserve to be a performer.
I played with all my might because I wanted my mother to get well, and yet...
There are tons of musicians in the same boat. I'm sure!
Ones who think, "I'll be darned if I do this," or "Why don't you play it?"
And yet, you pick it up again... and you sit before that score.
That's how...
...you create the most beautiful lie of all.
We're still only 14, you know! Let's pull out all the stops, and dive right in!
Like this!
Bombs away!
Glug!
She survived!
Ooh, that was scary!
It feels so good!  I've always wanted to try that!
Everything you say and do...
It all sparkles so brightly.
It's too blinding for me, and I end up closing my eyes.
But I can't help aspiring to be like you.
Do you think you'll be able to forget?
That moment, when my music reached them...
Go!
It's gonna change your whole world!
There's no way I could ever forget that.
Huh? No way...
Onii-chan!
There you are!
Scary stuff!
There's no way I could ever forget.
Because I'm a musician,
just like you.
Gray Skies
Huh? Where are your glasses?

Watch Again Next Week!
Come on, Kousei! Don't cry over a skinned knee!
You're a man, aren't you?
Look at me! My ankle went "snap!" That's right, "snap!"
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
It's your fault for making me do the...
Oh, shut up!
But thank goodness you only hurt your leg.
If I'd gotten your hands hurt, I would've gotten killed by your mom.
Stop crying, dummy Kousei! You're making me cry...
Here. A towel and a change of clothes.
I'll put your uniform in the dryer.
Thanks.
Where's your family?
My dad's away on business a lot.
Hey, it's bigger than I thought.
There you are. Is coffee okay? I can make you some hot milk, too...
Wh-Wh-What...what the heck?
Sorry, okay? Sorry...
Sorry...
Sorry...
Wholesome playing starts with a wholesome environment!
First order of business - cleanup! Air this place out!
Hey, you're next door, Tsubaki-chan!
It's not what it looks like!
There's a good reason for this!
Kao-chan?
In Kousei's clothes? With wet hair?
Whaaat?
She sure is fired up, that Tsubaki.
Isn't she just on a rampage?
I guess false cheer is better than none at all.
Is that me?
Yup! What you just played - on tape!
Your set piece is Chopin's Etude Op. 25 No. 5.
No way!
The tempo and sound are so out of sync! This isn't me!
He sucks, huh?
He sucks.
Huh!
Competing like this? I'm backing out! That's right, if I act now I can still...
I've already sent in your submission.
Is that my wallet?
So what kind of competition is this?
It's the Maihou Music Competition.
A national-level contest that's spawned many a renowned musician.
If you win Nationals, you might even get the chance to perform overseas!
Oh, really?
Awesome!
What Kao-chan's saying sounds like  something from a faraway, different world...
I've got to study under some teacher!
Face it. This is a challenge!
You're gonna prove that you can play even if you can't hear the notes!
"It takes courage to sail in uncharted waters!"
Who said that?
Snoopy.
A dog?
Woof!
The important thing is your imagery.
"Before your fingers touch the keys,
you must determine in your mind how you're going to play it."
Anton Rubinstein.
Why do you play the piano?
Is it for your own sake? For someone else's sake?
How do you want to play this piece?
How does the real you want to play Chopin?
So anyway, I'm counting on you.
You two take it from here!
Oh! You stink of sweat!
I'm gonna work hard!
Our break will be over soon.
Die!
I see...
So it's just you and me again, huh?
Chopin... Is that Kou-chan playing?
Oh, so he started playing again?
Should I take a snack over to him, maybe?
What's your mental image?
A horse-drawn carriage
Unoriginal! Lack of imagination!
over cobblestones in Europe...
Image?
Sunny-side up eggs for breakfast...
Mundane! Unromantic!
Image!
Image.
Image.
Image.
What is an image, anyway?
Is it different than how you interpret the music?
How do you want to play this piece?
How do I want to...
...play this piece?
She looks like an angel.
As long as she's quiet.
How are Regionals going?
We've never been readier. The only thing I'm afraid of is injury.
How about you guys?
The other day Arima-kun had smoke coming out of his ears.
I think it'll actually be visible soon.
I think he might be pushing himself too hard.
I mean, he was kind of reeling in the hallway.
I do want him to play the piano. But I don't want him to suffer.
Right now, Arima-kun is trying to turn that suffering into notes.
Exposing both his pain and his suffering, even his own struggling self...
That's how he'll come to dwell inside his music.
That's how we play music that's alive.
Arima-kun is in the middle of doing that. I'm sure of it.
We...
Why are you so supportive of Kousei, Kao-chan?
I guess I'd have to say...
He's like a hopeless kid brother, maybe?
Kousei...
...isn't hopeless at all...
Bye.
Yeah, see you tomorrow.
Hey there.
I'm on my way home from practice now.
I was wondering what you were up to.
I'm on my way home now, too.
We're always heading home at the same time these days, huh?
Tsubaki?
In that we...
...there's no me...
Huh? What's that?
Senpai?
Yeah?
Why don't we... go out?
Music Preparation Room
How do I want to play this piece of music, I wonder?
For what?
Good job.
Who do I want to play it for?
Why don't you pack it in for today?
It's totally dark outside. The moon's so pretty!
Just a little longer.
Do you resent me?
Something Tsubaki-chan said. That you're suffering.
I've known that as well.
I realized it when I saw your room.
Unable to hear your music,
you try to abandon the piano... Even as you cling to it for support.
That's why, as if you're turning your back on it,
you try to hide it under dust and books.
You love it, but you can't go near it. You miss it, but you can't touch it.
Even though you're grieving, though you're hurting.
And I pretend that I don't see that.
"Play the piano!" "Work hard at it!" Irresponsible things like that - that's all I say.
You're suffering because of me...
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
It was you who swept away all that dust.
I look like I'm suffering, huh? That's not good...
But of course I'd be suffering.
I mean, I'm gonna sail in uncharted waters, right?
Both taking on a challenge, and creating something, is painful.
But it's fulfilling. So thank you.
My world had already changed long ago.
It's just that I never realized it.
For sweeping away the dust that had collected on my body...
Thank you...
For encountering me...
Ever since that day, my world... even the keyboard...
became colorful...
You stink...
The girl that my best friend likes.
As if we're hiding from the silver moon,
the two of us in this music room, in the middle of the night...
It's like there's no one in the world but us.
Uh, we will now begin the rally for Regionals.
Now then, let's hear how pumped up--
What lucky boys you are to have been born in this era!
After all, you're going to be there when a star named Ryota Watari is born!
Man, I'm cool!
I'll show you all,
a good time!
Uh, let's start over. Next...
Music Preparation Room
Lame.
This is boring.
Average.
Pedestrian.
But I can see you've got the set piece down pat.
Even if I can play the sheet music perfectly, it doesn't change anything.
Chopin's whispering to me.
"Where are you in all this?"
Hey.
Why don't we go cheer at Regionals? For a change of scenery.
I'll pass on that. I'll only be the same as before if I leave it like this.
I'm going to transcend perfection.
Like you.
Nothing doing. We're gonna go cheer!
If you shut yourself up in here, you'll suffocate.
Musicians need time to gaze up at the sky!
Last inning!
Tighten up the defense in the hole!
Don't let anything get through!
Just do it!
We're counting on you, Tsubaki. If we don't at least tie it up...
I know.
Let's go, Tsubaki!
Kousei...
Play ball!
A famous violinist once said...
"Music transcends words."
Strike!
Tsubaki!
By exchanging notes, you get to know one another,
to understand one another.
Ball!
Let's go, Triple Crown champ!
As if your souls were connected, and your hearts were overlapping.
Don't miss any meatballs!
It's a conversation through instruments. A miracle that creates harmony.
In that moment, music transcends words.
Don't you think that's awful?
Making a girl carry him on her shoulders!
Well, but girls are bigger during childhood.
That's not the point! I'm talking about a maiden's heart.
But even though he's normally hopeless,
he's amazing when he plays the piano.
I mean, the other day he got a standing ovation...
Did I say something funny?
It's always the same.
You're always going on and on about Arima-kun.
All right! Through the gap!
Yay, Tsubaki-chan!
I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this.
Sure, I know. That I have no right to be feeling this way.
But I still don't like it!
I just don't like it.
We were always together. I was always by his side.
During times of joy, and of grief as well.
But...
I realize he's faraway from me now...
I'm not by his side... There's somebody else there...
What the...! Tsubaki!
Tsubaki
Stop! Stop!
I don't like this! Look at me! Look at me, will you?
Not with those eyes...
Don't look at someone else!
Out!
Ballgame!
Tsubaki, I'm going home this way.
But you live over there, Kashiwagi.
Let your boyfriend console you.
Boyfriend?
Sen...pai?
Kousei?
Yo.
Yo...
Kousei... this is embarrassing!
Well, no one's looking.
But nobody else was onto me!
Yeah, and how long have we known each other?
Where's Kao-chan?
She went home. She said, "Go to Tsubaki-chan by yourself."
After that roll down the hill, you carried me like this, even though you were hurt.
And then your own ankle swelled up like a handball, too.
Really?
You haven't changed at all since we were kids.
Oh, I've changed.
My heart is always wavering.
Nice try. But I know everything about you.
So you never have to hold back with me, all right?
I've always made you worry so much about me,
so I wish you'd let me worry about you once in a while.
I might be a flaky kid brother, but I'm gonna try hard.
I'm gonna try hard. So... I want the happy Tsubaki to watch me.
Because it would be too lame to ride on your shoulders forever.
Still, I gotta say...
You're lighter than you look, huh, Tsubaki?
So you are a girl, after all!
Wh-What's that supposed to mean? That's so weird!
You're right, that was a weird thing to say.
The seasons... might be about to change...
Who cares about music? Who cares about words?
We have the long, long time that we've spent together,
and we have so many tiny, precious memories.
Next time...
Next time, I'll give you a piggyback ride, okay?
We lost! We freakin' lost because of me...
After we all fought so hard! I'm so bitter, I'm so bitter!
Even though I'm bitter over losing, even though I'm depressed,
My ankle's killing me! We lost the game...
even though my ankle hurts, and my eyes are smeared with tears...
Even though I've never felt worse..
I wonder why the stars are sparkling like this.
The scent of the music room in his hair.
I can hear his slightly ragged breathing.
His shoulder, wet with tears, is so warm.
I am by his side.
I wish time would just stand still.
Good morning.
This is the list of Maihou contestants. Check out the flagged name.
It'll get you fired up.
I've been waiting for two whole years.
Now it's time for me to get revenge for all those years of humiliation!
I see you already know.
About what?
No use playing dumb. You sound so animated.
You're just imagining things.
I've been wondering what you were up to,  and now you've finally shown up.
Just you wait, I'm gonna wipe up the floor with you next time!
Kousei Arima Sumitani Junior Highschool
Kousei Arima!
On the Way Home
Hey.
How's it going?
It's coming up, huh?  The competition?
Don't get spooked!
Don't worry about it.... don't worry about it.
So what if you get humiliated, or if they all laugh at you?
It's not like they're going to abandon you.
After all, you're not Beethoven.
And of course, you're not Chopin, either.
I know that.
Oh? Well, then...
Who are you?
And where are you?
All right... Are you ready to go on your journey?
Go for it, Watari!
Cover him!
Here he comes from the right!
They switched.
Go!
All right!
Daito Middle  Sumiya Middle
That whistle...
...reflecting irregularly across the clear skies.
So Watari ended up losing, too...
Too bad.
Hey, don't cry. We gave it our best shot, didn't we?
Come on, we gotta go shake hands.
Watari!
Thanks for rooting for us.
You were really cool.
Well, I missed my chance at becoming a star. So the rest is up to you!
Let's play again in high school, okay?
Watari!
Seriously, you were cool.
So I'll have to wait till high school to become a star, huh?
Dammit!
Dammit! Dammit! No way am I gonna lose next time, all right?
Watari and Tsubaki... their last junior high tournaments have ended.
Maihou Competition
I'm at the point where I can play my selection by heart.
But...
Arima! We're in class here! Dial it down!
Three more laps!
Watari and Tsubaki both sparkled. And so did you...
You were there... so commanding.
Do I have a deep understanding?
Have I made Chopin my own?
Somewhere in this music  that follows these notes...
...do I exist?
Where exactly are you in all this?
Arima!
I don't know.
Somebody get him some water!
Go get the nurse.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Friend A!
Yes?
Yeeees?
I don't believe you!
Skipping meals... passing out! Your body is an important asset!
What was I supposed to do? I was totally immersed, you know.
I felt better after I ate the egg sandwiches Tsubaki gave me.
Five packs of them.
Five?
Hey, kitty!
Where are you?
Are you all right? There's a park over there, so...
When I was a kid,
I had a black cat.
She would eat my candy whenever I wasn't looking,
so I named her Chelsea.
I was fooling around with Chelsea like always. I guess I was over-attentive.
One day, she scratched my hand.
My hand was bright red. The blood was gushing, and wouldn't stop... I panicked.
The next day, my mother took her somewhere and abandoned her.
I'm doing this for you.
The scars Chelsea left me remind me of my mother.
Who knew one of my few memories would be something like this?
I just stared at my mother's back without a word as she took Chelsea away.
"Stop it!" or "Wait a minute..."
If I'd say something like that,  things might have been different.
Ever since that day, I've been in my mom's shadow.
You like egg sandwiches.
You also like Moo Moo Brand milk. Unexpectedly, you have a sweet tooth, too.
You're not good at sports.
You're no match for Tsubaki-chan,
and you're a little bit jealous of that chick-magnet, Watari.
You're not in your mother's shadow at all.
You're you. "To be like you..." - it's not so ambiguous as that.
No matter what you do, no matter how you change, it doesn't mean a thing.
You're just you, no matter what.
You and I weren't born in Europe, and we don't have weird haircuts.
We're not Chopin, after all.
Just play with sincerity, give the performance of your life with everything you've got.
You really have a way with words sometimes.
What was that? Sometimes? Listen, I'm encouraging you here!
With sincerity...
"When you're depressed, it always helps to lean your head on your arms.
Arms like to feel useful."
Who said that?
Charlie Brown.
Those are big, knobby hands. They're the hands of a pianist...
See? Just as I thought.
Your hands are happy to be touching mine.
They're beside themselves, itching to play the piano!
After struggling, losing my way, and suffering...
The answer I arrived at was so laughably simple...
Hey there. How's it going?
So-so, I guess.
The competition's tomorrow, right?  You still can't hear the notes, can you?
Will you be okay?
I don't know.
But see, there's this girl, and she seriously believes in the power of music.
I mean, like crazy.
So I think I'll try believing in it, too.
That's not really an answer.
I guess not.
You seem to be ready.
I'm sure that person will come, too.
You should take it easy today.
Tomorrow's going to be a big day for you.
Woah!
They're doing it here?
It sure is huge.
Well, I'll be going, then!
Kousei?
You're going the wrong way!
Is he gonna be okay?
Not good!
What? What?
Look at this.
The list of contestants?
Your entry number.
Kochel number 265, Mozart's Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
The stars will shine over your head.
Stars in broad daylight.
Hey, is that...?
Yeah.
An encounter with my past.
My competition begins now.
Competition Finalists
Yay!
Found it! My name!
But I thought I was in the zone...
How was your son, Kenta?
My child didn't qualify again. I feel bitter, but they were outstanding.
Emi Igawa and Takeshi Aiza...
They were head and shoulders above the rest.
The sheer amount of practice they've put in is obvious.
This was the fruit of all those lessons.
That makes it all the more disappointing.
Kousei Arima    Emi Igawa    Takeshi Aiza
Because it makes Arima-kun look that much better.
So they served as Arima-kun's foils yet again, right?
He really pisses me off, that Arima!
Because we lost to him again?
No way!
I'm just setting the stage to win the final.
But aside from that... That jerk!
He went home without even looking at  the results, like he just assumed he'd won!
I mean, would it kill him to look the least bit happy?
That in itself pisses me off!
He's not interested. Not in other people, and not in us.
Probably... not in himself, either.
You sure are cool about it.
Cool...
I've never been humiliated like this before.
Hot!
If he has no interest in us,
then I'm gonna force him with all my might to look our way.
I'll make him care. Someday... I swear...
I'm going to destroy you...
He looks a little more grown up. But he hasn't changed.
Those annoying black-rimmed glasses are the same. Arima...
Long time no see.
Right, Arima?
Uh...
Who are you again?
Not a lot of people here, huh?
On the contrary!
For a preliminary round, this is a pretty big turnout.
It could be the Arima-kun Effect.
Just now, in the restroom, all everybody could talk about was Kousei.
He's a really big deal, huh?
Why are you acting so smug, Tsubaki?
But listen, this vibe I'm getting is kinda weird.
Is he going to show off his mind-blowing technique again?
Exactly as the score's written, totally under his mother's thumb,
the secret marionette playing method!
Do people hate Kousei or something?
To follow the score, and to play exactly as the composer intended.
Now that's an incredible feat.
In a competition, they can only judge you for that,
but he can actually win just by being faithful to the score.
He can actually raise the bar...
That's what doesn't sit well with people.
Especially the younger generation, who seek out something from music.
Needless to say, there's jealousy, too.
I mean, Arima-kun did storm his way through all those competitions.
Hey! There was a time when he entered a lot of them!
I think it was around the time his mother was hospitalized.
Like a digital watch, never off by even a split second... Nothing resonates.
The Human Metronome. Made of concrete. His mother's puppet.
A slave to the score.
The name "Kousei Arima" is infamous!
What's that? Bring it on! Was it you?
Who said that? I'm gonna kick his butt!
Damn that Arima, he's totally forgotten us!
Now, now, calm down, Takeshi.
Don't lose your head.
You have an early start time, right? Go get changed.
And besides, it's not like Arima forgot us. He never knew us from the start.
He's exactly the same as he was two years ago.
I don't like him. Just because his mother as a famous instructor's student,
he got all that special treatment... But for someone with all those skills,
he never plays anything but boring music!
Judging will now commence.
The first time I met him was in third grade.
"Next time, for sure... next time, for sure..."
And just when I thought I had him, after stretching out my arms all the way...
Like a mirage, he faded into the distance.
He was like the dove in a magic trick - poof, he was gone.
Today, finally, he's returned to where he belongs.
I've been waiting for this day for two years.
At last...
The competition is about to begin.
I hate judging because it's so exhausting.
Huh? Asleep already?
Again? He's terrible!
No. 3, Miss Yuko Kawanaka, please get ready.
It's gonna be all right. You can do this. You can play it!
This is weird... Is it because it's been two years?
I've never gone through this before.
Like a broken see-saw, my heart's pounding like crazy...
Oh, no.
It's over.
Why isn't he playing?
Did he forget how to play?
That's one less competitor.
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared...
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared...
No. 4.
Aiza-kun, please get ready.
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared...
We're all afraid...
To get up onstage.
Maybe you'll mess up. Maybe they'll totally reject you.
Even so... You grit your teeth and get up onstage anyway.
Is it just me... or is there a different vibe in here now?
Well, of course.
The overwhelming favorite to win just took the stage.
Last year's champion, Takeshi Aiza.
Here he is. Now I can finally listen to the real deal!
Chopin, Etude Op. 10, No. 4.
I like your expression. Don't get overeager, Takeshi.
I won't be going to Germany.
I'm going to enter the Maihou Music Competition.
But they invited you.
This is a golden opportunity to get overseas exposure before the Chopin competition.
You already won Maihou last year, so there's no reason to make it a priority...
But there is a reason.
The Shadows Whisper
Episode 8 Resound
Watch Again Next Week!
Takeshi, you've received an invitation from the Schuberstein Competition.
It's in Germany...  You're finally going overseas!
The Maihou Competition's around the same time, but let's cancel that one.
Mr. Takayanagi.
I won't be going to Germany.
What?
I'm going to enter the Maihou Music Competition.
But why? They invited you, you know!
It's a golden opportunity that almost never comes up!
And you also need to get overseas exposure before the Chopin competition!
You already won Maihou last year, so there's no reason to make it a priority...
But there is a reason.
Kousei Arima might be competing.
You keep saying that, and how long have we waited?
But he hasn't shown his face in public for two whole years now.
There are even rumors that he can't hear anymore.
He might be competing this time.
Takeshi!
I know it's ridiculous.
But my goal isn't to go overseas, or to play in the Chopin competition.
My goal is Kousei Arima.
The competition that he'll be playing in.
It's gonna be all right. You can do this. You can play it!
I like your expression. Don't get overeager, Takeshi.
All right, that's a great start.
Takeshi!
Is she listening to another person's performance?
What an intrepid soul!
Arima?
Are you watching?
Are you listening?
Arima?
Could this be the same piano?
He sounds totally different than everyone before him...
Confronting the music with sincerity...
A strong will enabling him to stand up to his fears.
An unswerving fortitude at his core.
This is Aiza's Chopin.
I'm grateful to Arima-kun. He's the one who made him grow up.
Just by existing...
...you pushed the pianist, Takeshi Aiza to the top.
The reason I was able to hang in there during the two years you were gone...
...was because I always believed that you'd be back one day.
Have I caught up to you yet? Or am I even further behind?
Will you let me chase you down like a mirage again?
Will you be the one I aspire to be?
Hey, answer me. Show me what you've got!
Come on, now it's your turn.
Kousei Arima!
Huh! Well, I gotta admit he's pretty cool.
Just as expected!
Awesome, awesome!
Oh! He looked this way!
He's so cool!
What's up with that?
It's the TAKESHI Brigade!
A rival is a special thing. All the more so for adolescent boys.
A rival can make you grow far faster than being taught by someone.
It's all because of you.
It was you who made Takeshi reach those heights, Kousei Arima.
It was all for the sake of catching up to you...
That's what the piano is saying.
Do you feel that way, too?
Don't make me laugh.
It's over!
That was great.
Good job!
Now they start trembling!
Good job.
Well? Did you see that, Arima?
You were amazing.
Uh...
Hey, that was nothing.
Creepy...
There will now be a 15-minute intermission.
We will resume judging at :45.
He was really cool, wasn't he?
That was really tight!
Aiza-kun sure has great presence!
You could even say he's imposing.
He didn't make any real mistakes, either.
You can tell how grueling his practice sessions must be.
He doesn't look it, but he's a diligent player, don't you think?
Even though his mentor, Takayanagi-kun is so shallow!
Name of mentor: Akira Takayanagi
First place in all of his recent competitions.
He's certainly flying high at the moment.
He's a phenom ready to take the world by storm.
In comparison,
she's fallen quite far back in the pack.
Man, she's cute!
Let's see.
Oh crap!
Oh, it's Igawa-san. She's popular, too.
I knew they seemed familiar. When I used to go cheer Kousei on,
both that Aiza-kun, and Igawa-san...
I used to see those three together all the time.
I remember because their names were always at the top.
But of course, it was Kousei who always ended up in first place!
Yeah, and why are you acting so smug again?
So listen, is this Emi-chan any good at the piano?
She's got to be good. Because she's cute!
I know how to size up people.
I bet Emi-chan's gonna run away with this competition.
I mean, 'cause she's so cute.
Already using her first name?
Jerk...
Hmm, but I think Igawa-san's been struggling a little lately.
An honorable mention at the Kumagai Competition,
third place at the Tanizaki Music Festival,
and the other day, she didn't even make it past the preliminaries.
Sounds like she's been running hot and cold.
To think that those three always used to be a lock for the Top 3...
Pardon me.
Oh,
Mr. Takayanagi.
Hello, Ms. Ochiai.
Tell me...
How's it going with your student, Igawa-san?
What a snide man.
Aiza-kun's performance was masterful.
I'm sure it's all due to your instruction.
Well... thank you very much.
In my case, the student has surpassed the master!
But I do believe it's time for him to start thinking globally.
Since there probably isn't anything left for him to accomplish domestically.
No one can challenge him anymore in Japan.
You saw that yourself, didn't you?
In everyone's eyes, Takeshi is No. 1!
Today, he'll destroy Arima, and head overseas!
Feel free.
So how's she doing? Igawa-san?
That girl... Emi can be so temperamental, you see.
The most trivial thing can have a drastic effect on her performance.
Like her new shoes pinching her toes,
or her neighbor humming in a bizarre way...
She can even be swayed by the weather that day.
For the last two years,
it's been so hectic for everyone, trying to keep her motivated...
Because the goal she should have vanquished had disappeared.
But... it's different today.
The last two years... The goal she should have vanquished...
The goal she should have vanquished!
Are you implying that she doesn't see Takeshi as her goal?
Well, Aiza-kun doesn't see  Emi as a rival either.
"The results speak for themselves..." It's written all over your face.
Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Ms. Ochiai?
You're the one who threw down the gauntlet, Mr. Takayanagi.
We women are combative creatures. Do you understand?
Little boy?
We will now resume judging.
Aiza-kun's reign will end today. Emi will bring an end to it.
Ugh, goosebumps.
It's turning red!
It's been a while since I felt this way.
That's right...
It's been two years.
When I was five,
I went to a piano recital to cheer on a friend.
Just when I was about to fall asleep from boredom,
He appeared onstage.
He was such a bundle of nerves,
my heart started pounding.
That Arima-kun was? Hmm...
I found out later that...
that was the first time he'd ever performed in front of other people.
That moment of silence before his fingers touched the keys...
The time he took to bid his hesitation and confusion farewell...
The moment his fingers touched the keys,
my future was decided.
I did it! Oops!
What, you started bawling?
Embarrassing, I know.
I'm sure it was awkward for young Arima!
He was crestfallen, and beat it out of there.
My heart wouldn't stop pounding, and tears were filling my eyes.
All of my emotions came gushing out at once.
I was just so moved.
As if I was embodying all the pleasure music brings.
But he, on the other hand... Kousei Arima changed.
Like a machine.
His mother's puppet.
A slave to the sheet music.
A pianist made only for competitions.
So Kousei Arima's mother, Saki Arima, was dreaming.
I can understand that.
She entered her son in that competition to test him,
and her dreams for him began with his magnificent performance.
The dreams that she could never realize for herself.
And so she drilled him...
to give performances that would leave results, that could win competitions.
Exactly what the score calls for. Like a machine.
I get it.
As an instructor, it's painful not to be able to deny that.
But you're different, aren't you?
Because you're a strong child.
You know, she can be unfriendly, and she says stuff that sounds pretty mean,
but she really has a thing for you, you know, Arima.
For me?
Yeah, I swear, it's like she's in love with you.
I mean, she was always telling me...
"Takeshi, you don't know the real Arima, do you?"
So beautiful...
Pretty!
She just takes my breath away. Her, and the black piano...
I mean, really... what a sight!
What a lovely sound. But...
If that's all she's got...
It's true that Emi can be erratic.
Like a stormy sea,
the waves of her emotions are surging unsteadily.
That being the case - today...
It wouldn't be a surprise to see those waves reach their crest.
Hey, hey...
I'm in sync with the piano. My fingers feel light.
Today, I'm in the zone. It's probably...
...because the scone I had for breakfast was so good.
Because my new dress looks good on me.  Because I'm having a good hair day.
That's got to be it.
No, of course that's not it!
I'm not a child.
So why am I making excuses to myself?
He's here. After two years, he's so near...
He's gotten taller. He looks a little more mature.
But I knew him at a glance.
Ever since that moment, my excitement has been surging.
He's right there, and he's watching me.
Do you feel that way, too?
Don't make me laugh. Because I...
I've been playing the piano all this time in order to reject Kousei Arima.
I know that she has the technique.  But not at this level...
Go! Go! Emi!
Let it all out with a bang! Let your feelings reach them!
A fourteen-year-old girl has this audience enthralled.
Is she really a junior high student?
I'm going to reject you.  Even if I lose,
even if I get trounced, I'm going to reject you every time.
Playing for competitions...
That's not the Kousei Arima that I want to hear.
I'm going to reject you with my playing.
What I want to hear is...
Red, yellow, yellow...
Are these her emotions?
Red and yellow... Anger and...
Do you feel that way, too?
Yes, I do.
I'm only here because of you.
Just under four minutes...
A performance lasting just under four minutes...
That's what made me a pianist.
Come back, come back,
the Kousei Arima that I looked up to!
Let it ring! Let it ring!
Let it ring!
My piano!
Let it ring! Let it ring!
Let it ring!
I see...
Red and yellow. Her anger, and... Her loneliness.
Chopin's Etude,
Op. 25, No. 11.
"Le vent d'hiver" - Winter Wind.
Super-cute!
Dial it down, Watari!
Right... So you play by pouring your soul into the notes, too, huh?
Let it ring.
Let it ring.
Let it ring.
Let it Ring
Let it ring.
Episode 9 Resonance
Watch Again Next Week!
That Sunday... I...
What made you want to come to the park all of a sudden, Emi?
Come on down, it's dangerous.
I'm going to be a pianist!
At the top of the jungle gym,
I chose a future as a pianist.
I abandoned all my other infinite possibilities, and chose that one.
Come back! Come back!
Welcome.
Now, now, where are your manners?
How do you do? I'm Yuriko Ochiai.
What's your name?
Um...
What is it?
So that people who hear me will think, "I want to be a pianist, too..."
Will I be able to play the piano like that, too?
Come back!
If you wish for it hard enough, Emi-chan, I'm sure that the music will respond to you.
The piano will listen to you.
Can I play it?
Of course.
That's the only kind of sound I can make...
But the sounds that boy made
were just like sunflowers...
Kousei Arima, who I yearned to be like.
Every great performer played  for the first time at some point.
Even Mozart, even Beethoven.
Even the person who made you think, "I want to become a pianist."
What will you pour into your piano playing?
What wish will you ask it to grant you?
I...
I want to play the piano like that boy.
I want to stand on the same stage as him.
That way, I just know...
That I'll be able to see what he sees.
Let it ring... Let it ring... My piano!
Let it ring.
Is that girl for real?
That was insane.
Entrance to Greenrooms
Good job. You were amazing!
I...!
What? What? You confessing your love?
Sorry.
I'm gonna go change.
Before you catch a cold.
Just spill it already!
Right now...there's no need for words. Because I poured all my feelings into the piano.
There will now be an intermission. Judging will resume in fifteen minutes.
Did you see that girl who just left?
What a pile of medication.
Huh?
Yo, just spotted a hot girl!
What's the matter, Tsubaki-chan?
The closer it gets to Kousei's turn, my stomach... It's so much easier to deal with my own matches!
It's not like you're the one who'll be playing, Tsubaki-chan,
so just sit back and relax!
I know, but is Kousei gonna be all right?
Just spotted an angelic older woman!
He could be quaking in his shoes after that amazing performance.
And that's so not happening.
Cause you know what, he's a man!
We will now resume judging.
Thump, thump. My heart's pounding even harder than before.
Arima's choice of piece today is Chopin's Etude Op. 25 No. 5
Inconceivable!
Till now, Arima's always showcased his ability to play difficult pieces without a false note.
That's why I challenged him with my Op. 25, No. 11...
I'm sure Takeshi did, too...
But the song Arima chose to play today can't be considered a difficult piece...
It's inconceivable.
How did you pick out Kousei's piece?
It landed on 25-5, so...
You used a pencil to decide?
A pencil...
It didn't matter what piece he played.
As long as he entered the competition.
It really didn't matter at all.
Kousei Arima.
Please get ready.
All right.
Just by placing himself in this particular space, he's sure to feel stimulated.
There's no way he won't feel provoked.
The other pianists won't let him hang back. They won't allow him to stop.
After all, Arima-kun's a musician.
This is so strange. Is it because it's been two years?
My heart is pounding. It's so hot, and so violent.
Is it because I watched those two perform?
Without holding back, grasping with both hands, shaking my soul to its very core.
Check it out - this is who I am.
Watch me!
I'm the same as you.
I'm sure the clock's hands will move.
Time will start flowing again.
Kao-chan...
I never knew. That music could be this colorful, and that it even had a scent.
Are you ready?
I believe that he'll take a step forward.
So music can make your blood boil this hard.
Here he is!
It's Arima-kun.
Arima...
Arima...
Now even I'm nervous! I wanna go to the bathroom!
Hey...
Here he is at last, huh?
Are you ready for your journey?
Come on, we're gonna play dodgeball! You can just dodge all the time, okay?
Tsubaki... I'm in the middle of a lesson with my mom.
Whaaat? Not again?
Huh?
How'd you get that welt?
I was in a hurry, and I bumped my arm.
You really are a klutz, aren't you?
Kousei, hurry back now!
Whoa, that scared me!
Sorry, my mom's calling me, Tsubaki. Ask me another time?
Sure. Okay, then, good luck!
Chelsea
Sit yourself down.
All right, let's begin, Kousei.
No running in the halls.
Okay!
I brought you your laundry, Mom.
Oh, Kousei.
How did it go? The Nagai Memorial Competition?
I got first place.
Here's the certificate.
But Haydn's given you such trouble.
I practiced a ton!
Good for you.
That makes me feel better.
Your achievements are the best medicine for me, Kousei.
Well, I'll take first place again! If it makes you better, Mom,
I'll take first place as many times as you want.
So...
What's the matter?
He's standing still?
Don't waver. Don't be afraid.
Dammit, it's overpowering me!
We're all afraid, you know.
Go on!
Go on!
Go on!
Go on!
There's Kousei, under the spotlight again.
He's back.
The invincible one, the pianist who's a breed apart.
The one I looked up to...
Kousei Arima.
He's back... His unmatched accuracy. His playing - like a mirror image of the score.
The stainless steel-like piano inaccessible to the rest of us.
This is the Kousei Arima of two years ago.
I can hear the notes.
My fingers are moving. I can play the score exactly as I've memorized it.
I can play on the strength of my muscle memory.
How does the real you want to play this?
This is no different than how I've always played.
That's how it should be.
A musician should be a mirror that reflects the score.
Besides, you can't win unless you do it this way.
You're going to get first place for me again, aren't you, Kousei?
You were playing the piano this morning again?
I came to buy food.
Since my dad's away on business,  it's for me and my mom.
Hey, it's just egg sandwiches!
That's not very healthy.
Well, she won't let me use a knife.
I'll bring you something to eat.
We have oden leftover from yesterday.
How's your mom doing, Kousei?
My mom said she hasn't been feeling well.
She's going to be hospitalized soon.
But why?
I'm sure...
It's all my fault.
Huh?
What?
Oh, nothing.
My mom got mad because I couldn't play the way she told me to, and she ruined her health.
So I'm gonna take first place,
and make her well again.
First Place - Arima Kousei
Kousei Arima - The Child Prodigy
Arima's in first again?
The Human Metronome, huh?
Just go overseas already!
Bland and innocuous.
He's so in my way!
And he's nothing but his mother's puppet!
Shut up, shut up!
None of you know what you're talking about.
I'm the only one who's on Mom's side.
Next time, my mom's coming from the hospital to see me perform.
Oh, really?
So your mom's recovered now? That's great!
I bet it's all thanks to that visit from handsome me.
And my candy erasers!
Well, I don't think Kousei's mom knew what to do with them.
The entrance on the left side, facing the audience.
A spot where I can see her. That's my mom's special seat.
Mom's here today.
Right. Thanks.
So you see,
in order to make Mom well again,
in order to make her happy,
I'm gonna play my very best as a gift for her!
What are you doing, Saki?
Just what do you call that performance?
How many times have I told you to review the score?
You idiot!
Stop it, Saki!
Too harsh...
But I've never heard Arima-kun play better....
Misplaying both the third and eleventh measures!
I'm going to get one of the staff.
You make mistakes like that because you're drowning in your own emotions!
You're not going to bed until you can play that part.
Why can't you even play an easy piece like that? You're so worthless!
I'm in the middle of a lesson with my mom.
Whaaat?
Messing up the same part!
That kid's covered with bruises.
That's why he always wears long sleeves.
Who'd be that harsh with a kid?
She's a monster.
How dare you throw that score - you should be ashamed of yourself!
All I wanted was for you to be happy.
Even when I wanted to play with Tsubaki and Watari, even when you hit me,
I put up with it... I put up with it, and kept practicing...
All I wanted was for you to get better... All I wanted was for you to be happy...
And yet...
I wish you would just die.
That was the last time I said anything to my mom.
Kousei?
Hmm?
Are you going to compete in the final?
Yeah.
Since I did get through the prelims.
I know it's awful. My mother just passed away,
and here I am, worrying about the competition in a few days.
How awful is that?
Are you okay?
Sure I'm okay. Because that's  how I was built, after all.
I can't remember my mother's face that day.
It's like there's a big black hole peering back at me.
His mother just passed away, didn't she?
How can he play the piano like nothing happened?
He's not off by even a fraction. It's business as usual with him.
He's a demonic chip off the old block!
The entrance on the left side, facing the audience.
A spot where I can see her.
That's my mom's special seat.
This is... this is my punishment.
That's right, this is your punishment.
You understand that, don't you? My darling, darling little Kousei.
The notes...
Huh?
The sound of the piano... I can't hear it.
He's starting to unravel.
About Arima-kun...
Rumor has it that he can't hear the notes anymore.

Episode 10 The Place I Was at With You
Watch Again Next Week!
Oh, man, we lost!
Win Nationals, take my third straight national high school title,
generate unprecedented Watarin Fever,
reluctantly move to the U.K....
Stir up the rumor mill with a model,
lead the league in goals,
win ten Ballon d'Ors in a row...
My life of smooth sailing...
...kind of got derailed.
I botched my chance of becoming a star.
Setbacks come with the territory of becoming a superstar.
It's more dramatic.
Same thing with Messi.
Then it's the perfect deal for you.
I'm gonna hand over the role of this season's star to you, Kousei.
I'm not you, Watari.
Damn straight.
I'm me, you're you. I can't appeal to Tsubaki's maternal instincts,
and I can't play the piano.
You still can't hear?
I'm scared.
I can't get it out of my head.
I'm scared... I'm scared...
The idea...
that I won't be able to hear the notes again.
Well, setbacks come with the territory of becoming a superstar.
In the face of adversity,
that's when you know if someone's the real deal or not.
Or so they say.
The stars shine at night, you know!
Chopin, Etude Op. 25 No. 5... Was it...
Is this really what it sounds like?
It's so fast, and so rough.
Just like when he accompanied Kao-chan,
the notes are all over the place...
And he's only going faster and faster.
Here we go again.
It's not ringing out.
The sound of the piano...
The sound...
I'm about to be consumed by a deep sea...
Not yet! Focus, focus, focus!
Give the piano your undivided attention!
Just like that time...
Grab hold of the notes with your whole body!
This is your punishment.
Kousei.
Your punishment for rejecting me...
for rejecting my dream.
You understand that, don't you?
He's atrocious.
Arima... Don't tell me he can't hear...
This is merely grating on the ears!
Arima...
But you were able to play the opening perfectly without a missing a single note!
Is it because you can't perceive the sound?
Is it true that you can't hear your own playing?
Because this is...
...the sound of someone writhing in agony.
Even if I can't hear the notes anymore, I can tell.
My cells are howling.
This isn't Chopin!
This is your punishment.
You're wrong!
The notes have abandoned you.
You're wrong!
I worked so hard, just for you, Mom!
The piano is you.
No matter how hard you pound it, it won't answer you, will it?
The reason you're lonely...
The reason you're all alone...
I wish you would just die.
That's your punishment.
Maybe I'll just stop.
The tension is fading away from his playing...
Is he planning to stop midway?
I'm still the same old me, after all.
To play like I did before... maybe I expected too much?
I thought that if I entered this competition,  something would change.
But I'm the same old me.
Nothing's changed.
No...
Don't stop!
What's this?
He's going to stop playing.
Not that Arima...
Better to just cut his losses...
Don't stop! Keep playing!
You can't stop!
Look at this.
Your entry number.
Kochel number 265, Mozart's...
Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
The stars will shine over your head.
Come on! You gotta be kidding me...
Is this the Arima I know?
Absolute perfection, unmatched accuracy.
He's just a shadow of his former self.
The Kousei Arima who I looked up to.
What were those two years for?
Enough... stop messing with me!
He really...
Stopped playing...
So the prodigy has fallen back to earth?
What does this mean?
Disqualified. He won't be evaluated.
Humph... It's over.
Kousei Arima
No matter what the reason is,
if you cut short your performance...
The competition is over for you...
Oh, man, it's all over now, huh?
Here we go again.
Two of a kind. Birds of a feather.
That day, the moment I stopped playing,
the competition was over for you.
What was it that you were playing for?
You're so merciless.
No matter what I see, I'm reminded of you.
You really have no mercy.
Even the you that's here inside me.
You won't let me give up.
That day, what were you...
What were you playing for, I wonder?
Again!
He started playing again?
It's no good.
He might've started playing again, but the tempo's uneven.
The important thing is your imagery.
How do you want to play this piece?
Who do you want to play it for?
That day...
For what... for whom were you playing?
Friend A.
I want you.
I can't hear the sound of the piano.
I hereby appoint you as my accompanist.
Hey, that's right...
I... I'm going to play for you.
His playing is changing yet again.
The opening was as robotic as a computer...
following the score to the note, dead-accurate...
Then midway through, it was like a sobbing child pounding the keys...
Three times, he transformed.
What just happened to him? This transformation is unreal.
It's like there were three different pianists playing.
Not only has his playing changed... the sound has changed.
His notes...
They're starting to sparkle.
I stopped playing midway. I'll be disqualified...
Just like a certain ruthless tyrant I know!
The stars will shine over your head.
Just play with sincerity, with everything you've got.
How does the real you want to play Chopin?
We're not Chopin, after all.
You're just you, no matter what.
The words I exchanged with you...
...each one of them is raining down on me, like stars.
The sky I looked at alone seemed like it was about to swallow me up, and I was afraid.
The starry sky I looked up at with Watari seemed capricious...
...and the starry sky I looked up at with Tsubaki
was so incredibly brilliant, it somehow seemed unstable...
The starry sky that I look up at with you - what will it be like?
There's the smell of chalk.
A window with unsightly cracks. The sound of distant sports teams.
The shadows of cherry blossom petals. The faint breathing of someone asleep.
The scenery is changing...
This is Arima's imagery.
Everyone's being swallowed up into Arima's world.
We might not be able to turn in a performance that we can live with.
But we're going to play.
As long as I have a chance to play, and there's an audience that will listen,
I'm going to play with everything I've got.
Check it out - this is who I am!
Let it ring!
So that the people who've heard me will never forget me.
So that I can live in their hearts forever.
Just one person matters to me.
Only you matter.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Is this really that Arima?
I wonder why?
If I don't hold back, I think I'm gonna cry.
I suppose I'm getting old.
Hearing such straightforward emotions puts a pang in my heart...
Come back. Come back...
Arima!
I can hear her soft breathing as she sleeps. Like a cat.
A single petal that drifted into my life.
The worst first impression ever. The girl who likes my best friend.
Will it reach her? I hope it reaches her.
At last... He's returned.
You're here inside me now.
You're here.
You're here...
Kousei Arima!
It's just as that girl said.
Music is freedom.
You're free.
Uh...
Oh, right... time to applaud.
What was that?
Was it good? Or was it bad?
Sure, that would throw off anyone.
How am I supposed to evaluate something like that?
Is it resonating?
Is he still transitioning? Is this some kind of omen?
Not the slightest trace of regret on that face.
No feedback. Well, of course not.
Only one person matters to me.
Will it reach her?
I hope it reaches her.
The Scenery I Shared With You
Lamp of Life
That was offensive! Outrageous!
Could he have been less prepared?
Sir! Shh...
Just as he says, that really sucked.
I wonder if he even studied the sheet music properly?
Still, those notes of his...
They felt like April...
That Arima-kun...
...is an intriguing boy, isn't he?
The puppet has severed his strings and started walking on his own.
Of course...
Those newfound emotions do seem to be a bit much for him to handle.
I wonder what happened to him?
To that prodigy, Arima?
Hmm, not bad...
Mr. Mediocre!
Watch Again Next Week!
Heroes are powerful.
Heroes are lonely...
...and they walk off alone in the final scene.
He was just like that, too.
My hero was just like that.
Was that good?
He was disqualified the instant he stopped playing.
Only scattered applause. A confused audience...
Well, why not? Only one person matters to me.
Will it reach her?
I hope it reaches her.
There will now be an intermission.
A competition is...
A competition is a sacred garden of music.
Under no circumstances is it  a place to find yourself.
Still the same prickly old geezer, huh?
And he's escalated with old age. God help us. Hey, Mr. Mediocre!
Seto-san?
It's Hiroko-san, remember?
S-S-S-Sorry!
You cut your hair.
For a second, I didn't recognize you.
Hey, a woman changes her 'do every time she finds a man.
And besides, it's been two years.
Who's the stunner?
Somehow I think I've seen her before...
Damn you, Kousei, keeping her from me. I thought you were my friend!
She's that lady who was always with Kousei's mom.
Hiroko Seto. She's Japan's leading pianist.
Hello, Koharu-chan. Do you remember me?
Since she was classmates with Arima-kun's mother, Saki Arima, in college,
it makes sense that they would know each other.
Here, there are all these Kouseis that I know nothing about.
Huh? Huh? Hiroko-san, everyone's staring!
Hey, Hiroko. Hold him, will you?
Huh? How do I do that?
Support his head.
Gently, now.
Isn't he adorable? His name is Kousei.
Are you going to turn him into a pianist?
Not if I can help it. That's such a demanding job. He's my treasure!
You've got to turn him into a pianist.
But...
Kousei's a genius.
...me. Help me...
Kousei. I'm sorry.
Mom...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
You got so big, Kousei.
You smell like cigarettes.
All right, our nostalgic reunion is over now.
Your friends are glaring at us with the scariest faces.
Whoops! Busted!
You're going to stay for the results, right?
No. I'm out of the running anyway, and I'm not here for results.
Yeah, the way you bombed was all kinds of extraordinary!
That's really harsh...
Even so, you should be there when the results go up.
It's important.
By the way, which one is it?
The girl with the long hair?  Or with the short hair? Hmm?
Which is the girl you're in love with?
It's not like that.
It's no use,
lying to me.
Your piano was singing it out.
Saying, "I love you..."
Are you unaware? Or are you pretending not to notice?
Your hidden emotions. The you that you never knew.
The piano will drag out everything in your youth.
Brace yourself.
All right, see you soon.
It's not like that.
This is just gratitude...
After all, she's...
She's the girl who likes my best friend. And I'm Friend A, after all.
We will now post the names of those who cleared the first round of the preliminaries.
Maiho Music Competition Qualifiers Pianists Takeshi Aiza
Found my name!
Where?
What happened to Arima-kun?
So Arima's name isn't listed, after all...
Emi Igawa
Heroes don't succumb. Heroes don't crumble.
Just as expected. I stopped playing midway, after all.
No way!
I did it! There's my name!
What, I didn't make it again this year?
I'm gonna work hard towards  next year's competition.
And this was my last chance...
I'm so bitter...
I'm so bitter... So bitter...
Takeshi...
What was up with that performance?
What have you been doing all this time?
My goal is Kousei Arima.
Flip-flopping between playing styles like that...
Turning in such a train wreck of a performance!
Where did the almighty Arima go?
The lonely pianist, my hero - where did he go?
My hero is made of super alloy... my hero never loses!
You knew that if you stopped playing, you wouldn't make it past the prelims.
So why...
Why do you have that look on your face?
Heroes always win, no matter what. This is like... it's like you're actually human.
I see. So it was a train wreck.
Then that means I turned in another sloppy performance.
Rumor has it that Arima can't hear the notes.
He really can't hear the notes...
But I wasn't slacking at all. I practiced till I passed out. I gave my all.
You're just you, no matter what.
And if I still turned in a sloppy performance after all that, then...
That's who I am now. It's the current me, playing with everything I've got.
Mozart said, "Go on a journey."
I have no idea what lies ahead.
But I've taken the first steps.
We're still in the middle of our journey.
That's right.
I'm a musician, just like you.
That's why I'm moving on.
That guy's changed, huh?
I'll bet he's found it. A reason to play.
His playing...
For just an instant, you could see a mischievous child peering out.
Say something to him, Tsubaki.
He's depressed because he lost for the first time ever, that Kousei.
You go talk to him! You're a man, right?
I'm fine, okay? I'm totally cool with this.
R-Right!
A competition is a sacred garden of music. It's not a place to find yourself.
What was up with that performance? What have you been doing all this time?
I...
A robot.
The Human Metronome.
His mother's puppet.
If I'm a robot... If I'm a puppet...
I'm so bitter!
I missed my chance at becoming a star.
Hey... Kousei?
What? What the...?
What's up with these emotions? Something's moving me!
Run!
Run!
That's right. I'm the same as you, Tsubaki, Watari.
I'm a person, just like you.
Kousei's out of his mind!
Hold up!
I'm home!
Welcome home, Kaori. How was he? Arima-kun?
He was extremely entertaining!
What do you mean by that comment?
Details later!
There's a letter here for you, Kaori.
Oh? What could it be?
I'm going to get changed. I'm drenched with sweat!
Towa Music Competition
Kousei!
Kousei!
Are you up? You've been resurrected!
Zombie? Zombie?
Huh? Seto-san? Good morning.  What's going on?
You wouldn't pick up no matter how many times I called you,
so I'm here out of worry, you little punk!
Hey, aren't those the clothes you were wearing yesterday?
Would it kill you to take a bath? The filth!
Want me to give you a wash just like old times?
Whoa! I'll wash up myself. And I'll take my clothes off myself, too!
Huh! Growing up on me, dammit!
You were playing all night, until you passed out, huh?
Hiro-chan!
Look at you.
Boys will be boys, after all.
Here you go. Se- Hiroko-san, you take your coffee black, right?
Don't hold it where it's hot.
Is Takahiko-san still away on business? Ever the free range parent, I see.
Will milk be okay for you, Koharu-chan?
Well, it has been two years.
To tell you the truth, I never thought you'd take up the piano again.
Neither did I.
So what made you turn to the piano again?
It's almost summer vacation.
Nein! There'll be no breaks for us.
The day before yesterday, an invitation from the Towa Hall office arrived.
An invitation?
Towa Hall... as in that competition you and Kousei played in?
Is that by any chance... the gala concert?
Ja!
"Gala concert" refers to
a special performance held to commemorate something.
In this case, it's a recital to mark the heights achieved by the winners
and other top performers at the Towa Music Competition.
Hmm, so if it were a sport, it would be like an exhibition match?
Full marks!
And as the promoters' choice, we've been invited.
Me, and...
You.
So the almighty duo is back in business!
What are you gonna do?
What will you do?
Is our song for the gala concert set?
Yeah.
I want to do this one.
Huh? But this is...
Kreisler's Liebesleid.
Love's Sorrow...
Kousei...
We're playing this at the gala?
Normally, you'd do something more major, more showy.
This one's really subdued.
That's okay, that's okay. We're just the throw-ins, anyway.
There's no way anyone else will be playing this song,
and we're bound to stand out more if we play something chill.
These galas are all about standing out, don't you know?
F Kreisler Love's Sorrow
Let's do something else. Something cooler!
Sorry.
As someone who dropped you,
I don't deserve to be a violinist. I'm sorry.
Please bear with me for just a little longer.
That small back. So tiny, she looks like she'll crumble away at my touch.
All right.
Let's do this.
What made you turn to the piano?
One day in April,
I met a really weird violinist.
Totally outrageous. Self-righteous.
But the smile she shows to people she likes is angelic.
When I got onstage after she kicked, punched, and dragged me up there...
On that familiar stage, I saw a sight that I'd never seen before.
I want to see that sight again with my own eyes one more time.
That's what made me think...
That I'd like to become a really weird pianist!
I see.
Ouch. Ouch...!
Then who else but me to serve as your guardian?
Hey, what's with that horrified reaction?
No, no...
Please. Teach me to play the piano.
Doryo Bridge
Come on,
will you start taking this seriously?
I am. We played together for the first time. That's about what you should expect.
Are you really into...
Look, look!
They're pretty, huh?
Did you squash it?
So ephemeral and weak. But it's shining with all its might.
Thump, thump, like a heartbeat.
This is the light of life.
Uh, testing, testing.
How was it? Your first competition in ages?
You know what, I felt it there.
That everyone has something deep in their hearts.
For some it might be hostility.
Aspiration, hopes. The desire to show off.
To think, "Let it reach them."
Feelings for my mom.
We all had our personal emotions to lean on.
Maybe it's not possible for someone to get up on stage in an innocent state.
What about you?
What did you have in your heart?
What did you lean on?
I had you.
I'm... going on a journey.
The applause raining down.
Pursuing that moment when my music reached them.
Pursuing that sight of her with her back to me.
Until one day, for sure,
I've pulled even with her...  until that day comes.
Let's go home.
"You know, I'm not always going to be around to help you..."

31st - Gala Concert
You're totally distracted!
I'm doing what I'm supposed to.
You were playing reluctantly! It sounded like your heart wasn't in it!
Listen... Do we have to play this piece for the gala concert?
What's that? Is there a problem?
For a gala concert, we should be playing something more glamorous.
Let's change it to something more major...
No way! This is the song I want to play.
Don't worry, don't worry. If you and I play it, it will sound glamorous enough.
I wonder why you're so reluctant to play it?
When the score was overflowing with so much love for you?
Kreisler's... Love's Joy.
Love's... Sorrow.
Love's Sorrow, the companion piece to Love's Joy by Kreisler, was written for the violin.
There's a piano version of this song arranged by Rachmaninoff.
Huh? Did I stick it here?
Falling asleep under the piano again...
You're going to catch a cold.
You've gotten heavy, haven't you?
Kousei...
This is your punishment.
The piano isn't responding to you, is it?
I wish you would just die.
I can't hear! Help me, Mom!
I wonder why you're so reluctant to play it?
Why? Because it reminds me of my mother.
Hiroko-san, I've got to practice...
No sweat, no sweat! It's good to have a change of scenery, to take a breather!
Cotton candy! Frappes!
Hey, don't get lost on me.
Rachmaninoff's Love's Sorrow.
Saki used to play that all the time since we were students.
She used to play it a lot as a lullaby.
This piece just reeks too much of my mom.
So raw... and vivid... It closes in on me...
My mother must've had despised me, right?
No mother on earth despises her own child.
That day...
That was the moment you grew up, both as a person and as a pianist.
There's no way that wouldn't make Saki happy.
There you are! Sorry!
But it is just a little bit sad, you know.
To see your kid grow away from you...
My mom...
Do you think she'll forgive me?
For trying so hard to forget all about her?
Is it all right for me to play the piano?
If that's how you feel, play.
If there's something holding you back, then play with conviction,
and try to hear Saki's voice.
Voice...
"Don't sit there brooding over ridiculous matters,
it's high time you manned up!"
Play. You and I are pianists, you know.
A candy apple.
You don't like candy apples?
It's not like that. It's just that I've never had one before...
Don't cry! I'll eat it! I'll eat it, okay? Thanks!
Am I being too harsh with him? But he's got to play.
So that he can mature as a pianist...
So that he can say goodbye.
Jeez!
31st - Gala Concert
Look how late it is!
Yeah, because you wouldn't give up. What a baby!
What about you, you kept whining about the piece!
Since we're so late coming home, I wonder if your folks are mad...
Hey, look up there! At the sky!
You're ignoring me?
The stars are so beautiful. It's like the stars are speaking to us!
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,  like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
A cake shop?
I'm home!
Hold on a sec!
I'll be heading home now.
What do you want with my daughter?
Uh... I...
Arima-kun?
Arima-kun?
Hey, if it isn't Arima-kun!
These are just leftovers, but have your fill, all right?
Th-Thank you very much!
We've got some test samples, too, right?
Oh, but I've already had more than enough...
My parents are fans of yours.
When I was little, they came to hear you a lot.
I heard all about it, Arima-kun!
You shouldn't abort your performances.
That's like flushing all your struggles till now down the drain!
It's like baking a moist sponge cake,
only for it to be totally ruined by some horrible-tasting cream!
Sorry about that.
But I like a young man who does the unheard-of!
Good for you!
Once it's inside your stomach, there's no difference.
Since the ingredients are all the same.
Thank you very much!
Want to see some pictures of Kaori back in grade school?
She was so adorable!
We have some from kindergarten, too!
Don't show him!
Here, for your folks.
Thank you very much. And thank you for all the cake.
We'll be going to the gala concert to cheer you on.
Good luck!
Right, I'll do my best.
I'll walk you to the street.
So that's Arima-kun, huh?
He's got manners, and he's a good kid, don't you think?
Yes...
Really! They even hauled out the pictures of me as a newborn!
Stark naked, no less! I can never get married now!
You sure have cheerful parents.
My mom's always stuffing starving dogs with food.
Starving?
Huh?
Hey, did you get taller?
Huh? I don't know...
Oh, I see. It's because you're not looking down anymore.
Anyway, it sure is hot this year.
A meaningless conversation. Familiar scenery.
It's so humid! It's so deplorable,
it's really muggy, don't you think?
Even so, the reason I remember it so well is probably...
Oh, but I do like summer because there are fireworks.
...I'm sure...
...because of that summer night.
31st - Gala Concert
I...told...you!
Make that part flow more elegantly!
But the accompanist can't just ignore instructions!
Or else the violin won't stand out.
It will too stand out! Because I'm gonna be playing it!
It's peaceful.
You're so arrogant!
Follow what I'm doing!
Where's my green tea and red bean shaved ice?
It's not that simple! You runaway horse!
Huh? I'm eating it.
You monster!
That was my shaved ice! I've had enough! I don't want to go to summer school!
I want to play!
I want to go to the festival! I want to watch fireworks!
It's peaceful.
Done!
The year's first fireworks!
So pretty!
You sure we won't get caught?
Sneaking into the pool area and lighting firecrackers...
Oh, no worries!
I mean, the teachers have all gone home anyway.
And as for water, we've got a whole boatload at our disposal!
But lay off the rockets, okay?
Kashiwagi-san?
Oh, crap! Summer school again tomorrow!
Well, just suck it up.
It's your fault for being a moron.
Shut up, you lousy scholarship student!
What are you two gonna do?
I mean high school. You're not attending summer school,
so does that mean you two are on the music college track?
I'm...
...not even thinking about the future yet.
For now, let me just say that I'm going to rock the audience at the gala,
and claim the spotlight!
Because we're the almighty duo, after all!
That's the spirit, that's the spirit!
So glorious!
Yeah... those two look great together.
What are you gaping at?
Why? Why?
It's totally dark at the bottom...  I can't hear a sound...
It's like my...
Help me... please help me.
I can't hear anything. It's dark... it's dark...
The fact that you can't hear the notes means...
...that you're not bound by auditory sounds, I think.
Not bound by sound?
The images you have within you.
The sounds that rise up from the bottom of your soul...
You've been letting them override all else without realizing it.
The sounds within you, the imagined scenery...
Wasn't there ever a moment when you sensed...
the notes suffused with your desires and emotions?
Losing the ability to hear the notes. I'm sure that that's a gift.
A gift?
Close your eyes, cover your ears, and play as you feel for now.
You have the technical ability to pull that off.
The ability to trace the sounds within you, the sounds you imagine.
And those are the memories Saki left you...
Did you get taller?
Oh, I see.
It's because you're not looking down anymore.
It's because you're looking up now.
Kousei!
Kousei...
He's alive!
He's in pain!
That's proof that he's alive!
How could you...?
How could you drown in such a shallow pool?
Everyone's gonna blame me!
He freakin' slammed his head right into his savior's face.
Not bad.
Is it because it's a pool?
Is it because the moon's out?
Maybe... just maybe, the light can reach even the bottom of a dark ocean.
31st - Gala Concert
Miyazono-san's playing, too, right?
Yeah, that kid who stopped playing midway.
The people who run this are reckless for sure.
I think she'll actually make an impact. Can't wait.
Wonder if she'll play it right today?
She'll probably go bonkers again.
Well, I came today just to see her.
Curse
All right! There's nobody I know around here.
Emi?
Aren't you going to take your seat?
Ms. Ochiai?
Uh... did you call me Emi?
I'm the one who told you about Arima-kun being an accompanist today.
N-N-N-Not that I came here to see Arima... I'm just here to enjoy some violin music...
Here's your program.
Let's go. It'll be starting soon.
You witch!
No judging at gala concerts, so we can just sit back and enjoy ourselves.
With this level of talent, we can certainly afford to listen like everyone else...
Now then, is it almost time for my favorite?
Kaori Miyazono Sumitani Junior Highschool
What does she think she's doing?
The violinist a no-show? That's just insane!
Who is she, Michelangeli? Pogoreli?
The show's started. Kao-chan's not here yet?
What am I supposed to do?
Is Kaori Miyazono this unpredictable?
I've been calling her cell, but she's totally not picking up.
Watari-kun
This is serious. I can't...
Let's go in and get prepared.
So we'll be ready whenever Miyazono does show up.
Please, keep calling Miyazono's cell.
Right! Onee-sama!
I'm counting on you.
Ma'am!
Good luck!
What should we do?
I'll go ask if they'll move you guys down in the order.
Since it's a gala concert, they might be a little more flexible.
As long as we can get the performers to agree...
We can wait on Miyazono till the last possible second.
Why...
If that doesn't pan out, we'll just have to forget it.
Yes... you're right.
But why?
What will you do?
This is the song I want to play!
Weren't you looking forward to this?
I was an idiot for getting carried away.
It's almost Kaori Miyazono's turn.
Wonder what she's going to do this time?
It's been a while since I've felt this excited.
That's unacceptable.
Please! She's on a bus right now, on her way here!
Be that as it may,  I don't have the authority to...
What's going on?
Miike-kun?
Miike-kun... He's the final act of the junior high division?
That's right, being that he won the competition.
Nice timing!
Sorry, but could you let them play after you?
Our violinist's running late.
Running late?
Her name's Kaori Miyazono. I'm sure she'll be here soon.
You think you could let her play after you?
Miyazono-san's playing, too, right?
Can't wait!
Absolutely not.
The final act of this gala concert...
The starring role... it's mine.
Well, of course it is.
It is your moment of triumph, after all. We only have ourselves to blame.
I apologize for being so presumptuous.
Looks like we're going to have to withdraw.
A-Anyway,
it's her own fault for being late on a day like this.
Her playing's such a mess, no wonder her lifestyle's all messed up too.
She thinks she's special just because the audience kind of liked her,
so she shows up late without a second thought!
You don't have to go that far...
But isn't that a fact?
The music is written in the score.
What she produces is disastrous. It's not music or anything at all!
You little brat, who are you to talk like that?
All right, then. Sorry for causing a disturbance before you perform.
Come on, Kousei,
aren't you pissed at all? He insulted your partner!
Let's go by the program.
Please perform the final act of the junior high division, Miike-san.
However...
The spotlight!
Today's spotlight belongs to us.
The promoters' choice for the junior high division, Ms. Kaori Miyazono.
Here she comes!
At last.
It's Miyazono.
She got here in time?
It's Kaori Miyazono.
Isn't he the accompanist?
Where's the violinist? Where's Miyazono-san?
Arima, surely you're not playing alone...?
Unprecedented.
Kousei...

This is no fight. This is war!
If he apologizes, we're done for good.

Better brace yourself!

How can you play the piano?
Why wouldn't I be able to play the piano?

Let's turn Kousei into a pianist!
Kousei's...
Kousei's
...a genius!
I'm heading out now.
By yourself?
Yes.
Are you serious?
Yes.
What are you going to play? Without a violi-
I'm not changing the song.
It's not music or anything at all!
See, I'm pissed.
So I'm going to prove it.
Just how great a musician Kaori Miyazono is.
And besides...
This is a supreme directive from the shrew.
These galas are all about standing out.
Wait, this is a violin concert, right?
Is that accompanist going to play on his own?
This is all your fault.
Because you put me back on the stage.
Always... you always move me.
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
I'm going to prove it. That I'm incredible.
That Kaori Miyazono, who's named me to be her accompanist...
...is even more incredible!
Once again, unprecedented! Arima again?
This isn't the accompaniment. This is...
Kreisler... Love's Sorrow... Rachmaninoff's Piano Arrangement.
The song that Saki loved...
So you've been facing it alone all this time. But...
Is this the Love's Sorrow that you've always known?
Just watch...
Just watch... Just watch...
I'm incredible... Kaori Miyazono is...
...even more incredible!
Gala Concert
Unbelievable!
So powerful!
What a disappointment.
He's only venting his anger.
He's confusing crudeness with ferocity.
This grates on my ears.
Huh?
Was I pounding the keys that hard?
My whole body is taut...
This won't do at all.
This piece isn't... This isn't how you play it, right?
The song that I always listened to was...
This song was my lullaby...
I don't understand...
Even though I can't hear the notes as usual,
I can hear the sound inside me.
I think it means that you're not bound by sounds.
Wasn't there ever a moment
when you sensed the notes suffused with your desires and emotions?
Losing the ability to hear the notes...
I'm sure that that's... a gift.
Kousei...
Play it more gently.
Like you're caressing a baby's head.
Play it like you're embracing him.
Mom... This song... If it were her,
would she have played it like this?
His playing style just changed...
He's doing it again.
The sound is changing.
Kousei...
It's Saki.
Saki is there...
Saki!
Even for you, that's going too far!
Hitting him hard enough to draw blood - that's way too harsh!
You call yourself a mother?
Kousei was doing his best just to make you happy!
I know that! Of course I know that!
Saki!
I do know that... But...
I'm... running out of time.
Saki...
Help me... Please help me...
Somebody help me... The notes... The piano... My hearing is...
I can't hear the notes! Somebody... Please help me...
Mom...
Kousei...
I'm the one who drove you into this corner.
It's all because I told her to turn you into a pianist.
I'm so sorry...
If music only brings Kousei pain and suffering...
I'm so sorry...
Then I have no business being by his side.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Kousei Arima Sumitani Junior Highschool
But...
Kousei has returned.
What made you turn to the piano?
I want to see that sight again with my own eyes one more time.
That's what made me think...
That I'd like become a really weird pianist!
After losing Saki, Kousei...
...met someone who means the world to him.
If Kousei believes in that, then as a pianist,
how can I not believe in the power of music?
Saki. Be sure to watch this.
That son of ours
is about to bid you a last farewell.
Oh...
I can't help thinking about her, after all.
This song has my mother's scent.
Who are you going to play it for?
Will it reach her?
I hope it reaches her.
After I'm gone...
What's going to become of Kousei?
Will be able to earn a living?
Can he make music his livelihood?
All I can do right now is make him play accurately, faithful to the score.
As long as he has the skills, he just might be able to support himself someday.
What a terrible mother...
There's nothing I can leave that boy...
Will he brush his teeth every morning?
He falls asleep anywhere, so what if he catches a cold?
He isn't good at sports, so what if he gets seriously injured?
I wish I could've stayed with him longer...
Will my treasure... ever find happiness?
I knew all along. The ghost of my mother was a shadow of my own creation.
An excuse for me to run away.
My own weakness.
Mom isn't there anymore.
Mom... is inside me.
Yes, that's right. The piano...
...is meant to be played like you're embracing it, right?
Hey, hey... Mom?
There's both Love's Joy and Love's Sorrow, so why...
...do you always play Love's Sorrow?
I play it so...
...you'll get used to sorrow.
We're all connected.
Just like the notes are intermittently connected...
It's shared by us all.
Through music...
With the people you know,
with the people you don't know,
with all the people in the world.
You come, too!
Just like with her, I'm connected to Mom, too.
I'm moving forward because I believe that.
So... So...
Goodbye...
Goodbye...
My knees are shaking... Guess I'm exhausted?
Kousei!
Kousei!
Hey, look at you, hot stuff!
If my husband hears that his daughter threw herself into a man's arms,
he'll be devastated.
So did you get to see Saki?
My mom...
She's always been by my side.
Yes.
The way I touch the keys, the way I move my fingers, my habit of squeezing the pedals,
my tastes, the order that I eat...
Mom's in every little gesture of mine.
We're... Mom and I are... Connected...
Hiroko-san... Do you think it reached my mom?
The way I played my very best... Do you think it reached Mom?
You dummy. You two are connected, aren't you?
Of course it reached her!
Because of music, I was given the chance to meet others.
I was moved by those encounters. There are people that I got to meet.
I got to discover emotion.
These are all...
...memories that my mother, who taught me how to play the piano, left me.
Mom, I'm happy.
Thank you. Thank you.
Goodbye...
That was so exquisite...
I'm ready to just go home now!
Oh, the next performance, huh?
I don't want to hear anything right now.
I never thought I'd be so scared to go onstage.
Miike-kun...
Now this is a tough act to follow...
I want to run away...
Mom...
Would I have played my heart out like he did?
Would I have played with as much sincerity as he did?
I want to see if I can sacrifice body and soul like that.
I want to see if I can give it all I can.
Just watch me.
Right now, all I want to do is hear my mom's voice.
Is his playing softer than usual? I see...
So your heart's been pierced, too?
And you're both going to raise the bar, eh?
That was awesome.
Isn't violin music lovely?
Ms. Ochiai?
I'm glad that I'm a musician.
To obliterate a powerful enemy... Now that's the ultimate pleasure...
A bona fide extreme sadist?
Kousei...
...and Onee-sama!
Hey!
Kousei...
Huh?
Huh? This is so weird... I can't find the words to say...
Freaky...
Was it okay for you to just leave?
Well, why not? I was just a throw-in for the throw-in. And besides...
I've got to find that throw-in who blew me off, and rip her a new one.
He's mad.
All right, ready to head home? I'm exhausted from all this.
I want some juice!
Hey, your mom could go for some, too.
Tsubaki?
You've got nothing to say to me after all my hard work?
Huh? Um... You look all grown up.
What's up with that? I was hoping you'd praise me.
Huh?
What the heck? So weird...
If I don't hold them in, I might shed tears. Tears?
Tears of relief because I was able to talk to Kousei normally?
Or because I was able to talk to him normally...
...tears of disappointment?
31st - Gala Concert
If you were there at the concert,
you could've said something to me.
You're as spiteful as ever, aren't you?
Ms. Ochiai...
To think that Arima-kun was being mentored by you... That was unexpected.
After all, ever since Saki Arima passed away, you never went near that house.
That boy has changed, too.
He's become quite an intriguing musician.
Yes. Instilling something into his music,
leaving something in those who hear it.
That kid has taken his first steps forward as an artist. But...
The loss of Saki Arima
was tragic for Kousei, and for me,
but was it really necessary for Kousei Arima, the musician?
There's an ever-present sorrow hanging over Arima-kun's music.
If the death of his beloved mother
triggered something in him...
Totsuhara University Hospital
Then it's a demon's path that he must walk.
Kaori Miyazono
His growth is spurred by sorrow...
If Kousei is to walk that path,
Love's Sorrow
he might have to lose someone to move forward.

I thought if I came to the music room, you'd be here...
But I have no way of contacting you.
I don't know your phone number or your email address.

Kousei!
It's Kao-chan...
She collapsed, and she's in the hospital.

Hey there! How'd it go yesterday?
I was going to contact you,
but I wasn't quite up to it,
and so I thought if you could withdraw...
Sorry I couldn't make it.
Hey, what did you get?
Some cake from Yoshitomo. Girls like that stuff, right?
Her family runs a cake shop, you know!
Well, it's the thought that counts.
Here we are!
Welcome!
We brought you something!
Thanks!
Well? How do you feel?
Never better! I'm just in here for tests.
Did you miss not seeing me?
Sure I missed you!
Twice in such a short time.
But you were in here for tests the other day, weren't you?
That time, it was for new tests, just for the heck of it.
It is my head.
This time, it's also so I can rest up, and take more time to heal.
You just leered at me with a dirty look in your eyes!
Lusting after me no matter where you are!
An invalid! Is it because I'm an invalid?
I didn't! I didn't lust after you!
Well, I sure did.
But hey, that was a shock.
You don't show up, and next thing we hear, you're in the hospital.
It was a shock for me, too.
I mean, I stumbled and hit my head, and then...
Blood came gushing out! In spurts, you know! In spurts!
I was so stunned!
My parents totally lost it and sent me right to the hospital.
And now we're all caught up. Oh, the fig tart for me!
I've always tired easily, but lately I've had to expend a lot of energy,
so I guess I pushed myself too hard.
Yum!
She's expending energy as she eats.
I brought you some books, too! You've got nothing to do in here, right?
Are these books from the library? Did you bring them without permission?
There are some about music, too.
What's she gonna do with a ton of books?
What's the problem?
Well, Kao-chan, you'll be coming back to school by the second semester, right?
Yes, of course I will.
I must be imagining things. That answer just now...
To think that it seemed rehearsed...
All right, Kaori-chan. Let's hook up in our dreams, okay?
Oh, shut up. Bye!
Bye!
I don't have time to read all these...
Kousei Arima
Kaori-chan?
Yes?
Have your friends gone home?
Yes.
Then can we...?
Yes.
Please resume the IV drip.
Saito-senpai
Ah!
What do you mean, "Ah"?
Senpai just texted me. He says, "Let's go to the festival today."
Senpai? You mean Saito-senpai? You haven't broken up yet?
Of course not!
But why?
What do you mean? It's not like I don't like him anymore...
Then do you like him?
Well, of course...
I've always had a crush on him...
Then...
What about Arima-kun?
Tsubaki?
Tsubaki!
What...
Why the heck are you bringing up Kousei now?
Th-Th-Th-That's so ridiculous!
Kousei is...
Ever since we were little, we've always done everything together,
and rather than someone of the opposite sex,
I see him as a kid brother.
Kid brother again?
Are you trying to jinx yourself by chanting that "kid brother, kid brother" curse?
You're too scared not to.
Because the comfortable relationship you have right now would be destroyed.
Hey!
I was saving that omelette for last!
I told you, it's not like that!
I chose the wrong method of attack.
What the heck!
Arima-kun was afraid, but he still took the plunge.
Someday, there'll be no turning back, you know.
Hey, a yukata!
It looks good on you! You look really cute!
Hey, you don't have to be nice. Clothes make the man, as they say.
What did I tell you, Kashiwagi? Kousei would never say that to me.
Because he only sees me...
...as a nagging big sister or something.
I'm sure...
Anyway...
Today's the day of the festival, huh?
Yeah.
Don't stand there. Have a seat.
Uh, okay.
No, on second thought, I'll stand.
You sure are fidgety. Suspicious, much?
I don't like hospitals.
You're gonna be okay, right?
You're not lying about being tested, right?
You're not gonna tell me you're  never coming back to school, right?
You're gonna start cussing me out again, right?
We can talk in the music room again, right?
You...
Watari-kun was just here.
This is what he brought me.
Watari.
I had no idea. I hear you played alone at the gala concert?
Watari-kun told me about it.
Uh, yeah...
The accompanist playing a solo?  That's unheard of!
What kind of a show-off are you?
It was a gala concert for violinists, so it doesn't make any sense!
Don't make me laugh! Are you an idiot? My sides are splitting!
Whose fault was it?
What do you mean? Anyone would've expected you to withdraw.
At first... It was because someone insulted you.
But then midway through, the sound disappeared...
My mom's words, her gestures, her smell...
My memories of my mother turned into notes, and flew away into the sky.
I see...
You're an artist no matter what, aren't you? Kousei Arima...
Yeah... Just as I thought...
That song... She chose that song for me.
Love's Sorrow. This song reminds me of my mother.
The scent of fabric softener. The sound of the piano as I looked up drowsily.
A quiet lullaby.
The smell of antiseptic.
Footsteps ringing.
A linoleum floor, cloudy and white.
All overlapping with you.
Welcome.
I wish I could've heard it, your piano.
You're okay, right?
I wish I could've played with you again.
You're gonna be fine, right?
You're not lying about the tests, right?
You're not gonna tell me you're  never coming back to school, right?
I can see you again, right?
That's the second time.
What?
That you called me by my name.
You...
You won't leave me...
...like my mother did, will you?
The Sumiya Baseball Youth Sports Club special boot camp for sluggers will now begin!
Huh?
I wanna go swimming!
I wanna play video games!
Shut up! Ten sets of ten sprints down the beach! Begin!
But I don't play baseball. So how come?
Even people who play the piano need to build up their legs! I think!
Huh? You said "I think!"
Tiny footprints.
They are not! It's just that your feet are huge.
What? Is that any way to talk to a maiden?
Come back here, you!
Kousei, let's go to Ouji Park!
I wish I could, but I've got piano lessons.
Bah!
I was gonna show him a mud ball as shiny as a rainbow!
Great job, if I say so myself. It's a masterpiece!
I know! I'll make one for Kousei, too.
Kousei, let's play catch. I just learned how to throw a sinker.
Kousei-kun's going to be a pianist, so he's busy.
What would he do if he hurt his hands?
Scrub, scrub.
Sorry.
Scrub, scrub.
Scrub, scrub, scrub, scrub.
I hear Arima-kun's skipping school
to practice the piano, because he's got a competition coming up.
No fair!
Three, two...
O Vreneli, where is your home?
My home is in Switzerland
It is by the beautiful lake
Yo ho ho, tra la la la
I hate music!
Are you practicing hard?
You're slacking off because I'm not watching you, aren't you?
You don't have to tell me to practice! Every single day, both Hanon and Czerny!
That's not nearly enough! Practice Chopin, too!
When am I supposed to sleep?
Practice Liszt, too!
I don't know what this is about, but calm down...
Don't talk about stuff we don't understand.
I wonder...
Back off, will you?
I'm turning to you because I can't back off!
I'm not interested in girls who aren't in love with me.
All the more refreshing!
If someone tells her, "You're wrong," you know she's gonna sulk,
and get all stubborn, and then things will get complicated.
Especially when it comes to Kousei.
Agreed. I don't relish the thought...
But I... I want Tsubaki to smile again.
Even if she gets all bruised and battered, Tsubaki's still gonna have to realize it herself.
The fact that the guy by her side isn't her kid brother at all.
Watari-senpai, the scrimmage is about to start!
Right!
Thanks for the juice!
Thanks.
But that kind of thing...
...usually, you don't realize it till it's too late.
Hey, Arima!
Yes?
Have you made up your mind yet? You're the only holdout in my class.
What school you want to go to. High school...
High school...
That's what made me think... That I'd like to become a really weird pianist!
You should give it some thought. But let me know soon.
All right.
High school,
the future...
Who do I want to become?
He dropped it on the beach, and wouldn't stop crying, so I gave him my popsicle.
And then he says he wished it was milk-flavored!
Oh! Hey, sorry. There I go...
It's okay. It's fun to hear about Arima-kun.
There I go again!
Well, you live next door to each other, so of course you have the same memories.
He's like your kid brother, right?
No, he's not! I'm not Kousei's babysitter!
Then... what am I?
We're next-door neighbors.
He's the boy who's smaller than me, who lost his mother at a young age,
who I can't help doting on...
And the one I wished would get back on his feet.
What are you, an idiot?
Use your heart to solve those kinds of problems.
Oh, come on! I can't make sense of what you're saying these days!
The other day, you told me that you "didn't dislike" Saito-senpai, but...
"Like" and "don't dislike" are millions of light-years apart, you know.
Like? Don't dislike? I don't know what you mean.
You need to be honest with yourself and admit it, or someone's going to get hurt.
Do you dislike me?
That's crazy.
You're the senpai I always had a crush on.
Then do you like him?
Who is it that I like?
Like. Don't dislike.
Like.
Don't dislike.
Like.
Don't dislike.
Like.
Don't dislike.
Like.
Don't dislike.
Like.
Don't dislike.
Like.
Kousei?
Are you okay? Are you hurt? Sick? Is it food poisoning?
You shouldn't scavenge for food!
I got a call from Kashiwagi-san. She said you were in trouble!
Huh?
Oh, boy, she got me. Who knew Kashiwagi-san would pull a prank like that?
So she's human, too, after all.
It is strangely compelling, coming from Kashiwagi.
It's not a laughing matter.
I was running around like crazy because I believed her.
I'm dripping with sweat.
I want a popsicle!
Thank you very much!
Milk-flavored again?
It's what I like.
The moon's so pretty.
Well, I'm hearing it ad nauseam from the house next door!
I don't play it that much.
Talking like we always do...
I could hear some really lousy playing.
The banter... joking around...
They're bigger than mine. These are a boy's footsteps.
Kousei, you've changed somehow.
Huh? Really?
So weird...
If our eyes happen to meet, my heart flip-flops.
I'm sure...
Y-You did change. With you, I can tell right away.
It's because summer is coming to an end.
Your eyes sparkle now.
They light up, like the headlights of a car.
Especially...
When you're playing the piano.
It was pouring out of you... this gentleness, and a desire to convey something.
It's like you're shouting to the world, "I'm right here!"
You're the kind of pianist who can convey all that, huh?
You're an artist no matter what, aren't you?
Tsubaki?
Hm?
I'm going to go to a high school with a music course.
Music course? Are there any around here?
No, so...
...I'll be leaving home.
Hiroko-san said I only had to go to class twice a week or so.
Huh?
Of course, I'm not sure that I'll get in...
Huh?
Because I sat out for a while.
Huh?
Huh? Huh?
Again. Here it is again.
Music is taking Kousei far away from me.
Dummy! Kousei, you dummy!
Go wherever you want, dummy Kousei!
We're next-door neighbors.
He's the boy who's smaller than me,
who lost his mother at a young age,
who I can't help doting on...
And the one I wish would get back on his feet.
To go on like this, for all time...
The boy I took for granted would always be by my side.
The boy I want to be by my side forever.
Tsubaki...
I'm such an idiot...
Scrub, scrub, scrub...
I wonder if Kousei will be surprised.
Footsteps
Episode 15 Liar
Watch Again Next Week!
Hey, they're broken? But I hid them!
I guess they dried up?
But I worked so hard to make them! And they were so shiny!
Please don't cry, Tsubaki.
Shut up! Go away, idiot Kousei!
It's all the same to me whether you're here or not!
Morning!
Morning!
Wow, check out that tan!
I was in cram school all summer, so I didn't have any fun.
Morning!
Morning!
I'd like to take the entrance exam for Okutsu College of Music Affiliated High School.
That's in another prefecture.
Yes. I have permission from my father.
I'm leaving home.
For famous music schools,
it's all about how you ranked in competitions and who your instructor is,
so I might not make the cut.
Huh?
So my piano teacher said I should look into going overseas.
That she'd introduce me to a friend from when she was studying abroad.
Hey, you're thinking global!
Go to hell!
Give it your all!
Right.
Leave the prefecture, leave the country. Go wherever you want, for all I care!
You moron, it's all the same to me whether you're around or not...
If it's all the same to you whether I'm here or not...
So you're the type who can't hide her uncertainty.
6 meters, 21 centimeters.
I can read you like a book.
Holy crap! That's a school record!
You're covered in scrapes and bruises.
A Band-Aid on your forehead...
You guys are laughing too hard.
I'm humiliated.
You're gonna kill us!
Freakin' scary!
Tsubaki's been acting weird lately, don't you think?
Listen to you!
Why don't you leave her alone?
Well, excuse me for my horrible face.
For being covered with Band-Aids!
Laughing at me with that  nonchalant look on his face!
I was hoping you'd praise me.
I'm leaving home.
Talking to you either makes me feel sad, or it sets my mind at ease...
I'm such a mess... How lame is that?
Big Wheel!
Tsubaki?
It's just that your feet are huge.
Are you trying to jinx yourself by chanting that "kid brother, kid brother" curse?
Because you're too scared not to.
Uh...
Senpai?
Hey...
I met someone that I like.
Huh?
See, she's older, the manager of the baseball team.
She's really grounded, and she's got long hair.
She's the kind of person who eats potato chips with chopsticks.
Hey, come on, you know we're too alike.
I mean, we're both infielders, we've got short hair, and we're both rough...
And you always seem so uncomfortable being by my side, Sawabe.
I mean, you're always laughing like you don't know what to do.
You and I...
We should be with people who are the total opposite, probably.
Uh... um... I...
It's not our style to get all emotional, right?
So let's be ourselves breaking up.
Sorry...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What's up with that? I'm the one who's dumping you.
Why are you apologizing, Sawabe?
Thanks, Sawabe.
For being my girlfriend.
Hey.
Scoot over, I've got to practice.
Don't push me! I'll fall off the bench!
I thought I heard the piano making some strange sounds. So it was you, after all.
What do you mean, after all?
You're not asking me anything.
If you want to talk about it, I'm listening.
I just got dumped.
He was an older guy that I've always looked up to...
So good-looking and sweet...
He was like premium ice cream to me. No, not like ice cream...
More like a fancy,
120 ml...
The kind of ice cream that's not my style.
He told me he liked me...
I got ahead of myself... I got stubborn...
And then I got dumped.
And I...
...ended up hurting that person.
I'm such an idiot, I had no idea about my own feelings.
I wish I'd never realized...
Because I wanted things to go on just like this.
But...
I missed my chance to become a star.
I'd like to take the entrance exam for Okutsu College of Music Affiliated High School.
Time keeps flowing...
Both Watari...
and Kousei...
Even if they're afraid, even if it's painful,
even if they can't see ahead, still seeking something...
they take one step after another, mustering the courage to go on...
inspiring each other, supporting each other, they try to move on.
I'm the only one who can't take that first step.
Time does stop, doesn't it?
I'm the only one who's frozen in time...
What's your problem anyway? All you do is play the piano!
Music nerd! Can't you at least try to comfort me, you useless jerk?
It's all the same to me whether you're around or not!
Okay, then...
If it's all the same to you whether I'm here or not...
Then I'll stay with you.
I'll stay by your side.
That's so unfair! Being so nice to a girl who just got dumped...
It's not like I'm being nice to you.
I'm treating you the same as always.
Always by my side whenever I was in pain, whenever I was feeling sad...
The boy who's not my kid brother.
I'll stay with you.
Liar.
You're the one who's leaving me.
It might be too late now...
But I don't want to give up.
I may be an infielder, and rough, and I may not know anything about the piano,
but I want to be with this person.
I hate music with a passion. It's always taking Kousei far away from me.
Look at that, Tsubaki! The moon's out.
What do you mean? What's that got to do with anything?
But it's pretty.
I told you, don't be nice to me...
Don't snuggle up against me...
Move on!
Take the plunge, Tsubaki!
The time I exist in...
Start flowing...
Bravo!
Emi-rin!
Bewitching!
You're certainly training an intriguing girl, Ms. Ochiai.
When young talent collides, they polish each other until they each achieve a sheen.
Please thank Arima-kun for me.
Just you wait, Arima!
No...
Don't look back - move forward! Far, far ahead...
I swear I'm gonna catch up to you!
You're just going to visit her in the hospital, so what's there to worry about?
A crow?
A black cat?
Evil omens...
I guess I'll go see her another time.
All you do is make excuses.
The instant there's a little distance between us, it gets harder to see you.
Even though I didn't think twice about seeing you in the music room.
Now I'm searching for reasons to see you, and not to see you.
Cold!
A water balloon!?
Konnyaku?
A bucket?
Evil omens, like I thought?
Suffer! Suffer!
Wh-What's going on?
For crying out loud, Kousei,
Seto
would you mind not getting things to go?
It's not good for Koharu to see!
It's not what you think!
What's getting things to go?
Like burgers?
She's come to. Thank goodness!
Where am I?
What a sweet girl.
That boy over there brought you home, like takeout, when you fainted.
I'm telling you, it's not like that...
But you did get her to go!
What's getting things to go? Like pot stickers?
Um, by any chance...
What?
Are you Hiroko Seto?
Well, yes...
I should've introduced myself sooner.
I'm a first year in the music course at Kurumigaoka Junior High.
My name is Nagi Aizato.
Oh? That's a prestigious music school.
Yes, I'm studying piano.
I'm a pianist.
What was a pianist doing up in a tree?
I'm a huge fan of yours, Ms. Seto!
Please take me as student!
Huh?
Please!
Mm, you've kind of put me on the spot here...
It wouldn't be right to do that to your own teacher...
All right, then.
Could you convince me with your playing?
All right.
The way you carry yourself is first-rate.
Would you like to play Chopin? Or maybe Bach?
Well, then, Etude Op. 25 No. 5.
The piece Kousei played at the Maihou Competition...
Ah!
She's good.
But... Why is she playing it so harshly?
A song like this!
A song like this!
You're really good, huh?
I'd expect no less from Kurumigaoka Junior High...
Are first years today really capable of playing like this?
You sure can play at a high level.
Um... What do you think?
Hmm...
All right.
I'm so glad!
You don't have to cry...
I can't believe my idol, Ms. Seto, is going to give me lessons...
Eyedrops
Sneaked in.
Good for you!
Kousei?
Yes?
You teach her.
Huh?
Thank you very much!
No black cat or crow around.
I got her a gift, too.
It would be a shame to let it go to waste... Uh-huh.
I'm her accompanist, so it's only natural that I'd go see her.
Coming and going... I'm always searching for an excuse.
Kaori Miyazono
And so she's totally soaked, from head to toe!
And then Nakamura from Class 2, see,
he's laughing so hard he's got snot dripping from his nose!
No way!
And then I burst into laughter, too, so hard that I had a little drip going, too. Of snot!
What are you thinking, bringing caneles to the daughter of a cake shop owner?
Thank goodness I didn't give them to her.
I'm such an idiot.
Who's this?
You're so heartless!
Watari-kun's always coming to see me, so why don't you ever show up?
Monster!
Huh? How...? I never gave you my number-
I was just thinking that I hadn't heard your voice lately.
Hey, you're eating something, aren't you?
Yeah. A canele.
Lucky you! I wish I could have a canele.
I'll bring some to you sometime.
Really? That's a promise, all right?
Sure.
You're just like a cat.
If I approach you, you turn tail and head off, far away.
When you're hurt, you get all playful, as if you were trying to share your pain.
That's why... I feel so much love for you.
I'd like to have my dad's caneles.
Okay.
Promise me, okay?
Sure.
A canele eaten at night has a slightly bitter, gentle taste.
Hmm... Just as I thought.
I thought her face looked familiar.
Nous... Nous... Canele... Canele... Nous, nous...
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Stand up! Stand up! You're my legs, aren't you?
Stand up! Come on, stand up! Stand!

Episode 16 Two of a Kind
Watch Again Next Week!
Gala Concert
Huh?
What?
What?
I'm done.
Hey, get over there, teacher.
Your candid opinion, please.
Don't hold back, all right?
Holding back? What's that?
Make sure there's a distinction between fortissimo and pianissimo.
And count all the rests.
You wrinkle your brow when you play. Your posture's terrible.
Don't grit your teeth like you're in pain.
The rhythm of your left hand keeps lagging.
My hands are small, so my fingers can't reach right away.
Play those notes by moving your wrists.
Play the first beat with your little finger,
and then use that momentum to take your wrist over...
And move like this.
How about changing the way you step on the pedal at measure 333?
That won't help me win.
The score is impeccable!
In other words, it's God! We are all servants serving God!
Was she always this kind of kid?
Did her personality change?
Not to play exactly how the score instructs you to...
...is merely the selfishness of someone who's forfeited victory.
Just play with sincerity, give the performance of your life with everything you've got.
The score isn't God. It's not impeccable, either.
It's just an extremely emotional thing that humans created.
That's why it clings to you, like fetters.
What a cliche.
Blurting out naive drivel like that... No wonder you fell to earth!
Hey, I've got time before the lesson.
I was just thinking that  I hadn't heard your voice lately.
Hey, that's right...
I should get her some sweets...
Those caneles that you like so much...
I'm not even mentally prepared for this...
You're always showing up unexpectedly...
Oh!
Who are you again?
Amnesia? Because you hit your head?
I do beg your pardon. But as I haven't seen you lately...
You never come to visit, and the callous are easily forgotten.
I was just about to-
Hey, where's Watari-kun?
I'm lying in wait for Watari-kun.
Watari's...
Still at school.
He was in the classroom just now...
I am as kind-hearted as an angel. Callous though you are...
I shall give you a chance to make amends.
I'm appointing you as his substitute.
I guess you'll do.
And you do have a spacious bag.
So cute!
This cute one's mine!
Don't tug on my cute clothes!
Uh...
I've got a lesson...
Oh! Adorable! The new one for fall!
Adorable stationery!
What's wrong with email?
Hey, she's lost!
Why do you look so thrilled?
Attention. We have a lost child...
Miyuki!
Mommy!
Oh, you!
Can't just ignore someone in need when you come across one!
Heavy
Liar!
The mother was crying, wasn't she?
Yeah. She must've been really worried.
But you shouldn't make your mom and dad cry.
That little girl... when I held her hand, she squeezed it really hard. So adorable!
Like she was saying, "Don't let go, no matter what!"
I bet she was scared that if I did let go, she'd be left behind, all alone.
Oh, here.
Your drink.
Oh, I've been making you hold that all this time!
Oh, man!
Uniform... So you came to school today.
As it turned out, I was worrying for nothing.
Huh?
Where's your school bag?
Huh?
Let's go get it.
Seto
He's late!
Don't beat up the piano. Kousei's not coming.
What?!
He just texted me.
You should've told me!
You're okay with this, Ms. Seto? With such irresponsible behavior?
Hold on, you. You're always turning on Kousei. Why is that?
Oh, no! I just don't want to lose you to him, so I...
I don't know what your angle is...
But if you ever put Kousei in danger...
I'll kill you myself.
Wow, I can see he's loved, that Kousei Arima.
Well, he's my son.
Then...
why did you take me as a student?
Because I thought it would give Kousei something.
Something other than sorrow.
Are you sure you can trust the enemy?
Enemy? You're his enemy? Aren't you a fellow musician following the same path?
Oh, hey, look how beautifully you drew that.
Go on, show it to Nagi, too.
Here!
He's had enough of sorrow.
I want Kousei to become a happy pianist.
Wow! It's so dark! Really creepy!
Leaving your bag at school means double the trouble for us.
Where's your bag?
Um... Over here, maybe? No, maybe it's over there...
You lied?! Did you lie to me?!
My bag isn't here at the school...
Come to think of it...
You didn't have it this afternoon, either.
You did come to school today, right?
They let me out just for today. Sorry.
I wanted to come here no matter what.
Because I was starting to forget it...
I'm the one who should be sorry. You should've had Watari, not a substitute.
I mean, it was your one day out...
Are you going to forget?
The girl who explored the school grounds. The girl you helped rescue a lost child.
The girl who snuck out of the hospital and waited for you...
Are you going to forget?
So that I can live in their hearts forever.
The people here won't ever forget us.
I... won't forget.
I won't forget.
I won't forget, even if I die.
Right. I'm glad it's you, after all...
Are you okay?
I'm just a little worn out.
This isn't good, riding double on a school bike.
We'll get in trouble if we get caught, huh?
Sorry... about your lesson.
No big deal. It's Hiroko-san, after all. She'll forgive me.
It wasn't a meaningless day.
It was such a wonderful day, I wish that time would just stop in its tracks.
Thank you.
After shopping, and exploring the school at night,
the way back as a boy takes me home...
Just look at how the stars are twinkling.
Is it because it's chilly out? The words we exchange are so warm.
It makes you seem all the more closer.
I'll be Watari's substitute or anything. Forever... I want to stay like this...
I couldn't ask her the reason for those tears.
Too slow. The tempo starts lagging because you're not playing it in one go.
Annoyed
Annoyed                    Annoyed
But that's just what I'm doing. I'm playing it as fast as I can.
I can't play it any faster!
So here's how you do it...
Like this...
Why, you... Stupid machine!
Don't play it like it's a piece of cake!
Have you been listening?
Y-Yes!
I hate incompetent people.
Okay, then, let's just get this part out of the way.
But I hate Kousei Arima even more.
Nagi! You dumped Kamiyama-senpai, didn't you?
How many does that make?
Assassination Plan
Well, I can't stand the bookish, four-eyes type.
Anyway, did you decide what you're doing for the school festival?
Not yet.
The festival's in November. We need to get on top of it now.
We're allowed to invite guests from outside the school, right? Like graduates...
I hear Miike-kun's bringing in someone famous.
I don't have time for that right now.
Kousei Arima... how am I gonna make those guys eat it?
What a hideous stench!
It's reeking.
But our festival's known for its top students' unique performances, you know.
Normally, you'd be on fire in that kind of situation.
Top students...
That's right. I'm the angel of Kurumi Junior High. And yet...
Tengu?
Why is he yelling at me?
Too fast. Your fingers are slipping because you're trying to play it too fast.
That doesn't make it forte.
Huh? She ran off!
Go after her.
Huh?
That's your job, Kousei.
What am I supposed to do?
My hands are so small...
It's just as Hiroko-san said.
Humph!
Um... sorry about that. Uh, I've never taught anyone before, so...
Here, a peace offering.
You think you can smooth things over with a sweet potato?
It looks really good. Melt-in-your-mouth good. It's a Beni-azuma.
Yum!
Did I just cave in to a sweet potato?
Do you come here a lot?
I used to play here all the time, years ago.
With... my hero.
Come on, Nagi! I'm gonna leave you behind!
Wait up!
He was the one who started playing the piano first.
So I... followed in his footsteps...
You like him.
But he's obsessed with  someone else besides me.
And because of that, I feel lost now, and confused...
I'm in a dark labyrinth, deep inside my heart.
That's why I want him to notice me. That I'm here.
With my playing.
Why am I telling him all this?
Of all people... The pianist that I hate...
Talk about ulterior motives, right?
Most opportunities are, you know.
I might have wanted somebody to drive it away.
This obligation I feel towards playing the piano...
Paper, rock...
...scissors!
P-I-N-E-A-P-P-L-E!
Let's go!
Paper, rock...
...scissors. Oh...
Isn't there anyone you're into, Arima-sensei?
Two in a row!
Nope, no one.
G-L-I-C-O!
You're lying. There is someone... It's written all over your face.
Paper...
Rock...
What kind of person is she?
...scissors!
That can't be true.
C-H-O-C-O-L-A-T-E.
Because she's...
...a girl who's into a friend of mine.
Is that a good enough excuse to give up on her?
G-L-I-C-O.
Friendship over love, then?
How cliche.
Yeah, you're right.
But... this is the best I can do.
C-H-O-C-O-L-A-T-E.
What kind of person is she?
This girl, see...
She's like a roller coaster.
Crying, laughing.
She's got me at her beck and call.
Just by being around,
she transformed my monotone world into a colorful one...
She's a really dazzling,
really strong person...
Hey, you! Did you forget the caneles?
So heartless! You promised me!
They were sold out, okay?
Sweet Bean Jelly
Well, I brought you some delectable sweets.
My, Watari-kun!
True, Arima is slacking off.
I hear he's teaching a first year girl piano.
What!?
Introduce her to me!
How did you know that, Kashiwagi?
Even if I told you, Tsubaki, it's not like you're an expert on the subtleties of girls.
What did you say?
S-S-S-Sorry!
You messing with me or what?
Hiroko-san forced me to! I don't even want to do it!
A kiss mark!
You're the one indulging in unsavory acts!
Just what kind of lessons are you giving her?
No fair, Kousei! Getting a jump on...
Do you really think you have time to teach other people?
No, I told you, Hiroko-san...
Excuses again! You can't afford to be getting cozy with a girl!
If you have time to do that, then how about practicing more?
I'm doing my best teaching her. And when I get home, I do my own practicing.
I'm telling you, that's not enough!
Hey...
You're wasting the time that you're teaching!
Other people are practicing more! You just don't feel threatened, do you?
I told you, I'm practicing enough!
Then practice some more! There's no such thing as enough!
The competitions are going to start up in December, you know.
Do you actually think you still have time?
Before you know it...
Oops...
Okay, that was some crazy mode I went into.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
That trust of yours will soon plunge to the bowels of the earth, Kousei Arima!
Hey, did something nice happen to you?
Why?
The sound of your playing, it's skipping.
But you know sounds don't skip.
Well, if you put it that way, you're right, they don't.
But, yeah...
I have to say, they're skipping.
She's a girl who's into a friend of mine.
I don't see it happening for a useless wimp like him.
No way will things work out for him.
Just a little...
We might be just the tiniest bit alike.
Pursuing someone we can never have no matter how hard we try...
Gazing at them... burning with love for them.
I... I'm trying to destroy Kousei Arima.
A noble sacrifice.
I'm home!
A love that seeks nothing in return.
Aiza
Hey, you're home.
You're early, Nagi.
I am the phantom. The phantom who  lurks in the opera house.
I'm home, brother!
Hey.
Did you bring anything?
Oh, I forgot. Sorry...
You've been worrying about me, huh? After all, I was acting pretty weird.
Not like her.
Bursting into laughter at the drop of a hat, shrieking hysterically at trivial things,
bursting into tears out of the blue, turning so gentle...
Giving up on something...
Someone close to me was just like that...
She's not like her... Not like her at all.
It's not true.
It's not true.
It's not true.
"You really are a strange person..."

Two People on a Bike is Forbidden By Law
"Want to commit double suicide with me?"
Just kidding... I just thought I'd say it.
You see, I...
Are you going to forget?
Kousei, do you feel sick or something?
I'm okay.
I'm asking because you don't look okay.
Why don't we go visit Kao-chan?
We haven't been able to go together lately.
It's been a while, let's go!
Hey, good idea.
I'm not going.
Did he have a fight with Kao-chan, maybe?
You okay with that? Saying such a thing...
What thing?
Like rubbing salt into your enemy's wounds.
Enemy?
If he's having issues over music, then I don't know how to help him.
I just think that Kousei will cheer up if he sees Kao-chan, so...
Well, I don't think it'll kill you to dial it up a little.
For whose sake are you  studying against your will?
For whose sake did you choose a higher-ranked high school?
Choosing a high school near Okutsu Music College Affiliated High...
Who'd you do that for?
Oh! W-Well, you know! Kousei's totally helpless on his own, so...
If only you'd be that honest and tell him that yourself.
The truth is, I wish he wouldn't go at all.
It makes me feel anxious, and I get frustrated. I feel like being snarky to him, too...
When he said he wasn't going,
I know I felt relieved. And full of guilt.
And since I don't want him to see me like that, I'm doing my darnedest to put on an act.
Have I always been so horrible?
I'm discovering all these different sides of myself that I never knew I had...
Facing all these different sides of me.
I guess that's also... What you call...
...being in love?
Your head is miles away. Let's call it a day. Go on home.
I'm sorry.
Oh! Um, Seto-sensei, I have an emergency!
Sorry! I'm counting on you, okay?
Totsuhara University Hospital - 890m
Huh? Arima-sensei?
I was able to catch up to you just walking at a normal pace.
You walk too slow. Your posture's terrible!
You need to get a grip, or you'll look like a slob!
May your dreams come true!
So this Kimoto dude, he goes, "I'll play my oboe for you at the culture festival, Nagi-kun."
How deluded is that?
But wouldn't that be pretty thrilling?
Depends on who.
Comes down to...                                              probably their face.
You're such a realist!
Finally got you to laugh!
Thanks. Sorry to make you worry.
N-N-N-Not at all! Worry about you? Are you crazy?
It would be a bore to have a wuss for an enemy, that's all.
That guy, he's unbelievable, you know.
Everyone's freaked out because he's got the whole score memorized perfectly,
but he doesn't even bat an eyelash.
What is he, a gunman out of a Western?
Sounds like a die-cast robot with that heart of steel, huh?
Like a hero, right?
Dammit!
What am I... supposed to tell him?
Good luck... Don't let him beat you...
How irresponsible is that?
Kousei Arima Sumitani Junior Highschool
So...
Instead of thanking him, my selfish way of compensating for being so powerless...
...was only for self-satisfaction.
I'm an ugly phantom.
Kimoto-kun's gonna be a great performer, you know.
What? You think so?
It's more important than you'd think, playing for someone else.
What are you going to play the piano for? For someone else's sake?
You said you started playing the piano for someone else, right?
That's when you're able to play well.
When you've shared those sounds with tons of people,
when you've reached tons of people with those sounds,
when your hearts come together...
It might be that music transcends words.
That's just a cliche. Women are realistic.
We only believe in words.
May your dreams come true!
Ravel...
Welcome!
I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear Ravel!

Welcome.
I don't want to hear it. I don't want to think about anything!
I wish I could just stop hearing everything!
Music Preparation Room
Yo.
We're on our way to visit my Kaori-chan in the hospital. Come with us.
I'm gonna pass on that.
No need to hold back because of us. Come on, let's go.
I said I'm not going!
What's wrong with you?
Listen, you... don't you think you're being callous?
After Kaori-chan did so much for you, why are you running away?
Look at me!
H-Hey... Kousei...
Watari...
What am I supposed to do?
You see, I...
It doesn't look good for me.
It's not true. It's not true.
I'm so sorry.
...I made you remember something you don't want to remember.
I guess maybe we never should've met, huh?
I couldn't say a word. What could I have said to her?
How should I act when I see her?
Listen, Kousei.
This is just my opinion, but... I think you should go see Kaori-chan after all.
Sure, if she was okay with me, I'd do anything in the world.
If it was for a girl I liked, I'd even drink muddy water, just slurp-slurp-slurp, you know?
But you know what, I think for Kaori-chan, I'm not the one, you know?
When she wants her own way or needs to lean on somebody...
Whenever she wants somebody to do something for her,
it's you she always turns to, Kousei.
Enter a competition!
Be my accompanist!
I wish I could have a canele.
Please support me in this moment that I'm about to lose heart.
But I just don't know what to say to her.
Don't sweat it... you'll know once you're there.
A man can only take action!
But for me, it's impossible.
Whether or not it's impossible,
the girl will let you know.
"I didn't think you'd ever come again."
Because I promised to bring you some caneles.
Have you been practicing the piano?
Yeah.
How's school?
The same as usual.
How's everybody doing?
So-so.
What kind of answers are those? You don't even want to be here, do you?
Yes I do!
I do, but I don't know what to say, that's all.
Just go back to the way things were before.
You can just forget about it all, like you've pressed the reset button.
Tap, tap, tap... like that.
Why would you...
I won't forget.
And that will make your heart lighter. There's no point in remembering, anyway.
A violinist who can't hold  her own bow... that's pointless.
Why would... why would you say such a thing?
After all that howling, slapping me around,
forcing me up onstage against my will...
After carving so many scenes into my mind that I don't want to forget...
That's my canele!
Like I'd let such a cranky whiner have it? I'd feel sorry for the canele!
But I'm the one who asked for it!
I'm the one who bought it!
What's that?
That's that!
Not again...
You're irresponsible! I wash my hands of you!
Wait-
You really are a weird one.
I feel so bitter... so bitter...  And it's just so sad.
You gave me so many things...
Isn't there anything I can do for you?
If it was for a girl I liked,  I'd even drink muddy water.
I want him to notice... that I'm here... with my playing.
I drew this...
Whaaat? You want to perform at the culture festival?
A bolt out of the blue? I don't get it! What are you thinking?
You're really pushing it.
Please!
Fine.
No way! But it's your big moment.
What am I gonna do? Are you really sure?
I only asked because I had nothing to lose.
Grovel some more, Kousei Arima!
I don't really know where this is coming from,
but since I was struggling to come up with a program...
and I think it'll be intriguing...
Thanks.
Arima-sensei... why do you want to perform at the culture festival?
Hey, there, my princess.
Wanna discuss The Knight of the Rose with us?
We reserved a booth at a diner for you.
Nagi, let's have a crepe on the way home.
Can't do it.
You have a date?
Make it sound more springy. Use your wrists to play softly.
Maybe you should wait an extra beat. Speed up the intro and vary the pace.
No way! How many times did you go over it?
It's even more accurate than yesterday.
You're not eating?
No. I'm not really hungry.
I'm gonna go practice.
She's pushing herself too hard, don't you think?
I made a mistake! I'm sorry!
Don't worry about misplaying the notes sometimes. Let's hear you play it through.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Good luck! We'll be there, no matter what!
You're this year's main draw!
Ibata-sensei will be in the audience. So turn in a perfect performance.
If he acknowledges your talent, you'll be set for life!
I hear they're sending a reporter.
They're doing a feature on "a beautiful young female pianist."
Four more days.
I'm looking forward to this.
Four more days. I only have four more days to make this piece my own.
We have high hopes for you!
She gets extra points for her looks, don't you think?
The magazine writer's coming just to see Nagi.
She'll own everyone else without even trying.
Lolicon bait!
Your parents must be so proud.
Good luck!
She's nothing but a pretty face.
I've got to endure this suffering for another four days?
Hey! Nagi!
Help me, Mom... My hearing...
Once again, I'm a failure as an instructor. I'm about to let history repeat itself.
Nagi...
I...
I'm afraid. Even though it's just a school event...
even though it's not an important competition.
We're all afraid. Even me, even Kousei...
And I'm sure even Takeshi Aiza-kun...
Your whole life is condensed into a scant few minutes onstage.
Sure it's scary, and it makes no sense, either.
Then why are you still a pianist, Seto-sensei?
Once you get past that, there's a moment when the slate gets wiped clean.
All the months of agony, screaming, suffering, and struggling...
There's a moment when you're rewarded for all that.
When you've reached tons of people with those sounds,
when your hearts come together... music just might transcend words.
Maybe we're creatures who just  can't help ourselves... possessed by that moment.
It's a little like being in love.
We...
Gotcha!
Don't monopolize the bathroom!
I give up!
Koharu, at least take the left leg!
Your place is not here in the bathroom.
You're afraid to go out onstage because you practiced so hard.
You gave your body and soul to the piano, and that's why you're afraid to expose them.
If anyone calls you a "mentally unprepared coward," I'll kill them myself.
Throw out that non-existent chest of yours. You're Kousei Arima's apprentice!
No, I'm not! He's my enemy!
That's the spirit!
Now let's settle this once and for all, onstage...
Watari?
Huh?
I want you to do something for me.
Sure.
But I haven't told you anything yet.
If it's you who's asking,
it's cool.
Kurumi School Festival
Kuru School Festival
This is the scent of pure, musical maidens!
The place is packed with cute girls! Woo hoo!
You're like a walking hard-on.
Hey! This way, right?
Looks like it's already started.
Too bad they're plodding along like that when they've got those costumes on.
That's what makes them cute.
Nagi-chan will be up soon, right? How did that turn out?
Who knows? She wouldn't even tell me a thing about it.
Could it be that she's outgrown her big brother complex?
Must be sad for you, Big Bro!
Nah, it's a relief.
Good job, Komugi!
I think I did a good job!  Huh? Where's Nagi?
Namahage?
Bad kids will...
They're getting huge laughs?
That's gonna make a serious act like ours stick out like a sore thumb!
This school festival is a terrifying event!
Are you okay?
O-O-O-Of course I'm okay, why wouldn't I be?
You're quite calm yourself, Arima-sensei!
Lose your head more!
I'm so overwhelmed, I don't have time to be nervous, I guess...
That's right. The first time I met you,  your hand was trembling, too.
What do you think you're doing, you pervert? You sexual harasser!
If you squeeze my hand so hard, your fingers will lock up.
Now open up your hand... and relax...
We're all afraid. Even me, even Kousei...
Were you driven into a corner, too?
Are you afraid, too? The same way... I am?
A friend of mine told me once.
"Just play with sincerity, give the performance of your life with everything you've got."
But... I've only lived for thirteen years.
Even if it's only been thirteen years... for you,
and for everyone who's watched you till now,
it's thirteen years that can't be replaced.
Let's believe in it, the time you've devoted to music.
Performer No. 8,
please take the stage.
That's us...
All right, let's go!
Right.

Episode 18 
Watch Again Next Week!
Arima-sensei, why do you want to perform at the Culture Festival?
I've got this horrible friend.
And since she's feeling so sorry for herself...
I want to punch her, just once.
That's when I got the feeling.
That something might change.
Let's go.
Okay.
Nagi!
Wow!
She's a cute kid.
Arima!
Huh? No way!
That boy!
It's Kousei Arima!
With Aiza's little sister?
Isn't he her big brother's rival?
But didn't he retire?
Elohim, Essaim... Elohim, Essaim... I implore you...
What's that?
Hey, who knows?
Okay, good. Couldn't have  gotten off to a better start!
Nagi...
You've got to be kidding me. In the short time that I hadn't seen her...
She's gotten incredibly good!
Nagi... good luck!
I was all stiff from nerves,
but my fingers are moving.
I can hear both my own playing, and Arima-sensei's playing, too.
All that practice didn't lie.
I can't concentrate.
I can still hear the sound of the piano.
It's in my way.
You're in my way, so...
Get out of here!
Just now... the sound...
The sound... changed?
Kousei...
What are you doing?  What are you thinking?
You're supposed to be supporting me...
So why are you dumping  all this pressure on me?
Liar! Fraud! Moron! This is totally different from the way we practiced!
Both the rhythm, and this aching sense of atmosphere...
Every last thing!
This is Kousei Arima, pianist!
The tempo's starting to take off.
He's playing the bass, but he's starting to consume the melody.
What are you going to do, Nagi?
Are you going to let Kousei have his way with you?
Come on, settle it!
Bring it!
Nagi!
She's not giving in!
Amazing!
Aiza's kid sister is competing with him!
No matter how he goads her, or how he drags her along in his wake, she's keeping up.
Was she always this good?
Connected
That's right, Nagi. You're the star of this stage.
Don't even give him an inch!
That's right... in a waltz...
The melody shifts to the bottom part!
You're not getting away!
Listen closely!
Respond simultaneously!
Be enveloped by Kousei Arima!
Two months ago, I would've been left behind.
All that time... didn't go to waste.
The time I devoted to playing the piano... is paying off now!
He's got a heart of steel.
He's like a robot, isn't he?
Like a Chogokin robot, huh?
You're wrong about that.
Kousei Arima is no Chogokin robot.
He doesn't have a heart of steel.
After all...
When I touched it, his hand was warm.
The moment I touched it... that moment... was so nostalgic.
As the bass line player, he's magnificent.
He knows her personality, he's grasped her habits, he's goading her,
leading her on, and backing her up.
He's putting his partner in the zone.
He's accelerating her growth!
Those roasted sweet potatoes  we shared sure were good!
Those pork buns we had on our way home... they sure were good!
This is, without a doubt... their waltz.
I only started playing the piano because I wanted my beloved big brother's attention.
An ulterior motive.
Brother,
for the last few weeks, I've been peering into the abyss, just a little bit.
I cried, I vomited,
I went without food or sleep to immerse myself in music.
And it was so painful... so painful to look my powerless self in the eye,
that I wanted to run away.
You felt the same way, didn't you, brother?
It's important to play for someone else.
But you know what... that's not what I want to see!
Don't lose your way! Don't struggle! Step on it! Actions, not words! Don't stop!
It's not in you to lose your way.
Run up those stairs like you're skipping lightly.
Just like you did that day... once again, make yourself chase after that back of his!
My hero!
That's right... Just like Nagi saw herself in you,
you've been seeing yourself in Nagi, haven't you...
...Kousei?
Unlike everybody else, I don't yearn to become a pro,
and I'm not prepared to give all of myself to music,
but there are people who will listen.
There are people I want to play for.
There are people that I love.
So... I want to be here. Is that wrong?
Isn't that a good enough reason to want to play, for now?
What am I doing here?
What am I doing, looking up at  the stage from the audience?
I'm supposed to be up there, aren't I?
Emi and Nagi... why does your playing move people...
...Arima?
It's about to end. Ah... it feels so weird.
I'm exhausted, but I want to go on playing till I collapse.
Did I play it right? Was I able to confront it with sincerity?
Hey, Arima-sensei.
Why are the sounds you make so colorful, and so beautiful?
It's so beautiful that...
I think I'm gonna cry.
Go on, acknowledge them!
Oh, right.
All the months of agony, screaming,
suffering and struggling...
Amazing!
Bravo!
Marry me!
Aiza!
Nagi!
There's a moment when you're rewarded for all that.
Music just might transcend words.
Arima-sensei? Do you think it reached him?
Yes. It reached him. I'm sure...
What about you, Arima-sensei?
Were you able to give her that punch?
Yes. I think so...
A performance that won't be forgotten.
Huh!?
No fair!
I'm Christine. The girl who yearns to go onstage at the opera house.
What are you going to do, Takeshi?
Even as she lost her way and suffered,
big-bro complex and all, Nagi climbed up that stairway.
How long are you planning to sit around twiddling your thumbs?
Are you okay with that?
I...
Didn't you get anything from that? From Nagi's performance?
Are you planning to just sit tight here?
It's over!
That was a great duet you played!
Nagi!
That was amazing!
It didn't move me one bit, okay?
Satsuki... Komugi...
I'm not the one who's amazing.
Whoa!
You really are an ultra-sadist.
Hiroko.
Isn't music fun?
Huh? What are you talking about?
Isn't it too thrilling for words, watching somebody grow?
Nagi!
I get it.
So that's why you placed that kid under my wing.
Seto-sensei!
How was it?
You know what, since you guys started coming over,
I've been enjoying myself like there's no tomorrow!
Hey Arima!
Huh?
You're Bushi... Aiza...
It's Takeshi! Takeshi!
Ouch! Ouch!
Damn you, don't grab hold of my kid sister!
Kid sister?
Let me introduce him. This is my big brother.
Huh? But Aizato, your last name's...
Oh, please! I introduced  myself properly, remember?
"I'm Nagi Aiza!"
I said it right, didn't I?
You did.
She did.
I see. So I misheard you.
I'm glad you're so dense.
Never mind that! Why the hell were you playing a duet with Nagi!?
Well, I... I asked Nagi, as a favor...
None of that "Nagi" business!
You mean "Takeshi's little sister!" Don't you dare look at her as a woman!
Hey, You're killing me...
Hey, cut that out, brother!
What's this? You defending Arima?
I mean, how'd you get to know Arima, anyway?
He's looking after me here. He's teaching me all kinds of things!
All kinds of...!?
He's giving me all these precious experiences!
Experiences!?
Dammit!
Brother!?
December.
The Eastern Japan Piano Competition will begin.
And that's where I'm gonna give you a beatdown, got that!?
Arima!
Brother...
Bring it on! I'm gonna do it!
Flaunting something like that before my eyes... How can I just let that go unanswered!?
Oh, man. December's gonna be a pain in the butt.
One-tenth... even one one-hundredth... Did my feelings get through to him?
Did my music reach him?
You did a good job.
Thank you... very... much.
Kurumi School Festival
Hey, Aiza!
Huh?
Miike?
What the heck? He's never even  said a word to me before...
What the heck is going on here...
A-Aiza... Wh-Why were you playing a duet with Kousei... Arima?
Do you know Kousei Arima!?
"Kousei Arima"!?
Hey, you! Don't you dare drop the honorifics for Arima-sensei!
I'm gonna pull your hair out,  you damned midget!
Damned midget! Damned midget!
Arima-sensei!? What kind of relationship is that!? Tell me!
So do you have his contact info!? His email address, too!?
Of course I do! Yesterday, we had taiyaki together!
It was so yummy, that taiyaki!
Arima
You know his email address... The taiyaki was yummy...
No fair!
You knowing Arima... that's so unfair!
What was that?
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
How I wonder what you are...
Totsuhara University Hospital
I messed up again!
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
How I wonder what you are...
Up above the world so high...
Like a diamond in the sky...
Twinkle, twinkle, li-
Hey.
Hey.
Is that guy your boyfriend?
Boyfriend?
No, no, not at all.
That guy's what you call a jackass!
He's a jackass!
Jackass!
What do you mean a jackass!?
Well, you are!
Making a violinist who can't play the violin listen to this.
It's your fault that I miss it now.
I can't commit double suicide with you.
You're so heartless.
Well, look, when we went shopping, I was the one who carried your bags.
You always take the initiative. You only tell me things after the fact.
You walk in front of me,
and I'm always behind you.
What I always remember...
...is seeing you from behind.
At this rate, it wouldn't be double suicide, I'd be following you.
So please, give me one more chance.
Please give me another chance to stand by your side.
Please perform with me one more time.
But... I...
You're not a princess.
You're the daughter of a cake shop owner who loves caneles,
and you're not the heroine of a novel.
No way am I ever gonna play Ravel.
So please, perform with me one more time.
Besides, you're the one who said it.
"Do you think you'll be able to forget?"
You really are cruel.
I thought you knew that. I'm a jackass.
The air is chilly, and as dry as can be.
The laundered sheets lend a gentleness to my surroundings.
Such a cruel boy.
Telling me to dream one more time.
I thought I was satisfied because my dream had come true...
And I'd told myself it was enough...
Yet here you are, watering this withered heart again.
Hey!
You're making her cry!
What a vile jackass!
Enemy of women!
No, no, that's not what this is.
How dare you, jackass!?
Boys aren't supposed to bully girls, you know!
I'm greedy, so...
I'm just gonna dream again...
Of waltzing with you someday...
Hearts Come Together
I just might.

Totsuhara University Hospital
As I explained just now,
it would be extremely dangerous.
Not only that, but...
Even if all went well...
Yes, I understand... At least I think I do.
I've talked about it with both my mother and father.
I'm up for this. I want to have it.
The surgery.
Music Preperation Room
Kaori Miyazono [Connected]
Hey, you're off.
Come on, that's normal in the beginning.
You don't feel threatened! You're slacking off!
You've got the etude, too, you know! You have your back against the wall!
Don't you get that?
Sure I get it! Don't talk about it, you'll make me panic!
You were short on prep time from the start,
but thanks to all that flirting with that junior high girl...
I wasn't flirting with her!
What kind of convo is this?
You were too flirting.
They're fighting over the phone.
Was not.
Were too.
[Connected] Arima
Call Ended
Jeez!
Kaori-chan! Are you ready?
Oh, no! Just look at the time!
Oh, man, I only got a C.
Maybe I'll try for another school.
Hey, Tsubaki. How'd you do on your mock exam?
Entrance Exam Results - By School
Scored a B. Humph!
What, that bumbling gorilla?
What, Miss Muscles-for-brains?
I only asked her because I was sure she scored lower than me!
But she's Tsubaki!
I rule. Bow down before me, you dullards!
That's love.
Totsuhara University Hospital
She's not here.
What's up with that?
Totsuhara University Hospital
She's the one who said I had to check in regularly...
Don't tell me...
She took a turn for the worse...
What should I do? Should I wait for her? If I ask the nurse...
Well, what do you know? Arima-kun!
Miyazono-san's mother and father...
I-It's been a while...
Are you here to visit Kaori?
How nice...
Oh, it's... nothing. But I can't find her anywhere...
Then I know where she must be.
Keep going, slowly now...
Put your left foot out.
She says she doesn't want to lose her stamina or muscle strength.
Rehabilitation Room
She says that she wants to play the violin onstage, one more time.
Rehabilitation Room
Let's take a break, Kaori-chan. You're trying to do too much at once.
It's no big deal. Violinists have more stamina than you think!
This is all thanks to you, Arima-kun.
Kaori had given up... she'd thrown in the towel, really... And now she's starting to walk again.
One sure step at a time.
I... haven't done anything.
No, I guess not.
All you did was show devotion, right, Arima-kun?
And that devotion was what struck a chord in Kaori's heart.
I want to have it.
The surgery.
Even if it gives me only a little more time, even if there's only the slightest hope,
I'm willing to cling to anything.
There was a boy that I met in April.
I cried and vomited, and struggled so hard it was unseemly...
But onstage, I shone like a star, and my life seemed like a gorgeous rendition of a melody.
I made a promise with that boy.
He said, "Let's perform together again."
That's why I...
I want to struggle as hard as I can.
No matter how unseemly...
...or futile it may be.
I'm going to struggle,
struggle,
struggle like there's no tomorrow!
Because I'm one of them, too.
If I go on wallowing in my despair, and just give up,
I can never face my parents, who gave birth to me, and raised me.
Because it's my life...
If I just give up now...
I'd feel sorry for myself.
That devotion you showed, Arima-kun...
Kaori's heart had turned gray, and you gave it color.
So thank you...
Kousei Arima-kun.
Library        New Arrivals
He's been playing the piano all through the night. Every night, these days.
I know the competition's coming up soon, but it's right after the culture festival.
He's going to break down.
Will he do okay on his entrance exams? That Kousei.
Well, that's Arima-kun's way of studying to get in.
Huh?
Listen up. To get into a music-oriented high school,
sure they test you on regular subjects too, but achievements trump all else.
Those schools want to burnish their reputations by admitting the top performers at competitions.
Since Arima-kun hasn't competed in the last two years,
he's sorely lacking in terms of achievements.
And now the Eastern Japan Piano Competition is coming up in December.
It's got a long history, and cachet like no other.
So for the school, there's no better advertisement
than admitting the cream of the crop from that competition.
In other words, to get to the top of the heap at the Eastern Japan Piano Competition
is the same for Arima-kun as passing an entrance exam.
It's like hitting a walk-off homerun, see.
So why don't you stop being jealous of music, and root for him?
I am not jealous...
It's better than having him flunk and head overseas, right?
Now might be my only chance to be near him...
Arima-kun must be exhausted, playing so late into the night, huh?
If you brought some food over, I'm sure he'd be thrilled.
I-It's not like...
It's not like I'm doing this because Kashiwagi told me to!
Kousei?
Kousei, you're so light!
Huh? A Tosa dog?
Oh, it's you, Tsubaki. Was I asleep?
Don't sleep like you're dead!
Have you been playing non-stop? You're pushing yourself a little too hard, you know!
The required Bach piece... The Bach piece...
Your room's a total mess! Would it kill you tidy up?
You're so bothersome.
Are you showing up at the competition with that hairdo?
All right! Ready to go!
H-Hey...
Are you sure you can do this? You need a license, don't you?
Just leave it to me.
I always just cut my own hair when I need a little trim.
By cutting your own hair, you just mean your bangs, right?
I'll go the barbershop, okay?
You're only going to think it's a pain in the butt and not go!
Enough with the whining! Accept your fate if you're a man!
P-P-P-P-Please, I'm counting on you...
Aren't you cutting too much?
I'm telling you, no sweat! Remember how I used to do this for you when we were kids?
The competition's coming up soon, so I'm gonna make you look like a stud, okay?
You make it sound like I'm usually a real tool.
Kao-...
Will Kao-chan be coming?
What does Kao-chan say about all this? Kao-chan...
Don't be jealous of music.
But of course I am...
All I can think of is Kao-chan...
I'm such...a horrible girl.
Tsubaki?
I'm going to do my best. I don't know what the results will be,
But I'm going to give it my best shot.
The sound of the scissors, ringing in my ears.
His hair, a little hard to cut.
A scene of little significance passes me by.
Where's my onigiri?
Huh? Aren't you on a diet, Tsubaki?
What's that supposed to mean?
If this time turns out to be precious for Kousei as well,
that would make me happy.
I'm putting myself in your hands!
Hey! You're early today.
Don't you have to wait for your daily call from your friend with the glasses?
He's not coming today.
13:00 - Examination Room A 10:00 - 17:00 Examination Room B
Right now, I think he's in the thick of it!
Is No. 4, Kashima-san here?
Um...want this?
Right? This egg salad sandwich is light on the mayo and light on the salt,
which brings out its sweetness to the max!
And since they get these range-free eggs directly from the farms,
you can say it's the ultimate egg salad sandwich, seeking to capture the splendid taste of the egg itself!
N-Nothing's coming up but gastric juices.
Oh gross! Why the hell?
Emi... Arima...
Huh? Oh, sure...
I just hurled right now, you know...
All right!
Right? This egg salad sandwich is light on the mayo and light on the salt,
which brings out its sweetness to the max!
And since they get these range-free eggs directly from the farms,
you can say it's the ultimate egg salad sandwich, seeking to capture the
splendid taste of the egg itself!
If you put a thick slice of ham in there, it would be even better!
Yeah, it's tough not to pick the ones with extra mayo, too.
Makes you crave some tea, huh?
Yeah, but katsudon's a real man's meal.
The florentines here are delicious, too.
If we're having tea, I'd rather have scones.
The best milk is Moo Moo Brand.
The best kind of tea is Darjeeling!
Wow, they're really getting into it.
I like fillet cutlet sandwiches best!
See the chemistry?
No. 8, Takeshi Aiza-kun. Please get ready in the wings.
All right, then, I'm heading out.
I wish I could fire off a cool parting shot or something, but I can't think of anything.
I guess it's because...you know.
We're musicians, so everything's...
...gotta be expressed in music, right?
Oh, man, what an anticlimax.
All my nervous energy - gone.
Now I feel like something's off. Those guys...
...always getting in my way!
All right, let's go.
Are you ready?
Is your mind ready?
Okay, let's go!
Let's go!
Takeshi Aiza!
This is the stage where I'm parting ways with you.
...Ever since I was a kid, I hated being bored.
Konnyaku?
Next I'm gonna get Class Elephant!
I'm Take-chan of Class Giraffe!
My mother, who grew pessimistic about my future and the Aiza family's reputation,
Take that!
made me take all kinds of lessons.
One of them was...
Wow!
Piano.
You should have him learn from someone who's more of an expert.
If I win, I get a chogokin robot.
Piano's a breeze!
Just watch.
Emi.
Arima.
I'm gonna destroy you all at once!
Let's go. Takeshi Aiza!
Chopin's Etude Op. 10, No. 12.
Go! Takeshi!
Brother...
I'm so lame... It's humiliating.
I've disappointed my audience, I've made my kid sister worry...
And my enemies are throwing me their support.
So humiliating...
I'm no different than I was as a kid.
I lost again!
Brother!
Darn it! How could I... Whoa!
How could I lose to that cold-blooded expressionless girl and that sissy four-eyed jerk!
Darn it...
Darn it!
Darn it!
I'm not gonna lose next time!
Wow!
That's amazing! He raced all the way up Hyakudan Hill without stopping!
He's so cool!
Why didn't I see it before?
I thought I was the one who understood you better than anyone else.
But when I saw you for the first time in two years...
We're still in mid-journey.
He must've found it. A reason to play.
If it's an ugly performance, then that's the best I can do right now.
I think I kind of get it now. It was always like this...
You were the one who expanded my world.
I guess I never imagined that you'd show up like this.
The scenery that I'm looking for, and the sights that you wanted to see.. They're different, huh?
Immerse yourself. Immerse yourself.
Deeper and deeper.
Come on, Takeshi!
Contrary to appearances, he wants give a solid performance.
Try to really understand the composer's aim.
Follow in your predecessors' footsteps,
and experience the feel of blood and sweat-soaked score sheets.
No need to become Kousei Arima.
You're the one, Takeshi Aiza, who belongs to that line of pianists.
Now this is...
Takeshi's piano.
How cheeky. Are you going to push every inch of your intent through?
Humph! You little punk with that shallow jerk on retainer...
How dare you project such sensuality?
Go!
Move forward!
Move forward!
It's not just allies who support each other.
From your enemies, you learn so much, and gain so much.
Until the day you meet again...
Just knowing they exist helps you to withstand the loneliness.
Those who compete, even if they're enemies, help each other out.
I've been waiting for this day for two years.
I don't feel the slightest shred of boredom!
Now I can smash everything I have into something!
I'm not gonna lose next time!
I'm gonna demolish you!
There are amazing guys I can crash into, with every fiber of my being!
I'm so lucky.
Welcome home. My hero.
Bravo!
He's back in full force!
Brother!
Arima-sensei's competing too, so am I supposed to cheer him on, or Brother?
Tragic Nagi. What a cliche!
I see that a troublemaker's been awakened...
Chopin just smiled...
Takeshi!
Um...
I still have one more number to play.
Good job.
You were good. Especially the Chopin.
The second piece was really hard. What was up with that whole atmosphere?
You created that atmosphere yourself, didn't you?
You should've played the Chopin piece second.
Did I reach him?
Was I able to reach him with my music?
Like you guys?
Don't even think about messing up here, got that?
Cause I'm so gonna destroy you in the final round!
Don't make me laugh. After that shaky second piece!
What the...?
You'd better dial down the bravado...
You know what they say - all bark and no bite.
Dammit, both of you!
You better not have made a move on my kid sister!
Of course I haven't!
Grr! Make a damn move!
Or people will think Nagi isn't hot!
Whaaat?
See ya. My mirage...
Thanks for everything till now.
See ya... My hero...
Thanks for everything till now.
There are the results!
I see my name!
Really?
Final Contestants Aiza Takeshi Emi Igawa Arima Kousei

You're not a gorilla, Tsubaki.
You're a girl, Tsubaki.

Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
No way! I'll only be a third wheel!
You're checking in, right?  My Kaori-chan's waiting.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Hey, you, just because you made it through the prelims,
don't think you can afford to get cocky and loiter here!
Go practice, you loser!
You're the one who told me to stop by!
Today at school, see...
Yes, yes?
This one girl said she's  going to an all-girls school.
Okay?
I guess all-girls schools are kind of glamorous, huh?
What? I don't know about that.
Well, you'd fit right in, Kaori-chan! At an all-girls school!
What? You think so?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Kao-chan likes Watari, you know.
Watari-kun!
Watari-kun!
A girl who likes my best friend.
I'm a voyeur, and a substitute,  and a baggage handler,
and a pianist, and an accompanist, and...
I'm not Watari.
Hey, are you serious?
Your mom's gonna blow a fuse.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes so that she'll let me keep her.
My mom likes animals, too, you know.
I bet it'll be okay.
Drink this.
If you don't dry yourself off, you'll catch a cold!
I couldn't find Chelsea anywhere. Not at the junkyard or under the bridge...
If she's out here in this cold...
She'll die!
Even though I couldn't say a word, and I knew that my mom would get rid of her,
Chelsea still might have survived, but...
Puppet.
The human metronome.
They're exactly right.
I'm just a soulless puppet that my mother created.
That's not true, you do have a soul.
You've got all these good qualities - a ton! I know you do!
For example...
Like right now, you're running around like your life depended on it.
Isn't that because you regret it? Because you want to tell Chelsea you're sorry?
You do too have a soul, Kousei.
It's just that you're good at hiding it. So good, you can't even find it yourself.
So I'm going to find it for you.
So you won't lose your way, so you won't have regrets...
I'll stay by your side forever.
After all, I know everything there is  to know about you.
Going to the hospital today?
Yeah. She orders me to check in with her regularly,
then she says if I have time to go, I should practice.
Which is it?
Watari...
Watari came to see Kao-chan, too?
Tsubaki...
Looks like it's gonna rain. Let's head home today, huh?
I can smell the rain.
Hey, here it comes! It's coming down!
Here.
Thanks. I wish it would just snow instead.
You'd only wish that until it piled up.
If the snow had its own flavor, we'd have world peace, huh?
If our tap water was lemonade, it would eradicate the common cold.
Talking like we always do... The banter... joking around...
Suddenly having to take shelter from the rain.
That's a cute handkerchief you're using, Tsubaki.
A boy right next to me.
You're like a girl, Tsubaki.
You're a girl, Tsubaki.
So you're a girl, Tsubaki.
Liar.
I know you didn't want to. To go see Kao-chan.
Because Watari was there.
That's not it.
Liar.
Well, I didn't think we should get in their way. When it could just be the two of them.
No! You just can't take it!
It hurts to see Kao-chan and Watari laughing together.
That's why you're avoiding her.
I can tell right away when you're holding back.
Just like you stayed by my side, I want to stay by yours.
I can read you like a book, Kousei.
You like Kao-chan, Kousei.
Miwa said something once.
"The moment I met him, my life changed.
Everything I saw, everything I heard, everything I felt... all the scenery around me...
It started to take on color. My world began to sparkle."
Friend A!
Yeah.
What a moron!
Kao-chan likes Watari, you know!
She always did, remember?
As if she'd ever give you a second look!
I know.
When it comes to girls, if you're up against Watari,
you don't have a snowball's chance in hell!
I know.
Liar.
You said you'd stay by my side.
I can tell right away when you're holding back.
You don't know the first thing about me,
you liar.
You've never once thought of me as a girl.
What a moron...
Kao-chan likes Watari.
And you...
...have no choice but to love me!
Moron! Moron!
How's that for taking the plunge? Screw you!
I took the first step! I made him see me as a girl!
I went through a lot of suffering.
So you can suffer, too!
Suffer, suffer, suffer, and think about me constantly!
It finally started.
But what's gonna happen now? My heart's about to burst.
The rain in winter feels so good. It tastes like lemonade.
The time I exist in...
...just started flowing...
M-Morning.
Uh...
Hey, Tsubaki!
I'm exhausted. Let's go home. Don't you have a cold?
I just got caught in the rain. Don't worry about me, just pitch.
You're gonna chase them down, okay?
Sure thing.
Did something happen between you and Arima?
You trying to kill me?! Idiot Tsubaki!
It's your fault for saying  something freaky like that!
Humph! It's so obvious. You were so aiming for the music room...
Did you two fight again?
Nope.
I just gave Kousei a good kick.
Come to think of it, he was limping.
Imbecile! Smartass! Four Eyes!
Suffer some more for all I care!
No way am I ever gonna show up to root for you again! Live a lonely life!
Don't yell at me.
Think about me more, dummy Kousei!
Reach him...
Reach him...
My shot.
And you... have no choice but to...
What was that all about, I wonder?
She was just messing around, right? But for Tsubaki to make that kind of joke...
He's like a kid brother.
Enigmas... girls are such enigmas...
Seto
Hey, you!
Are you into this or not? You don't have much time before the finals in February!
I'm sorry.
What a cop-out of a performance. How cliche.
Did he wet his pants?
You're up against top talents loaded with grit and passion.
Whether you'll be going on to high school here, or leaving the country,
how you do in this competition will decide your future as a pianist.
Better man up, you're standing at the crossroads.
You don't have to come to the hospital anymore.
Huh?
The final's coming up soon, right?
If you have time to come here, you should go over the sheet music.
Pound even one more phrase into your head!
So anyway, bye bye now!
What's up with that?! She's the one who told me to check in regularly!
She's so selfish! So irresponsible! So outrageous!
Was it... something I did?
Maybe I shouldn't have eaten that chocolate bar at the hospital.
And I don't say anything when I'm there.
Maybe I pissed her off by talking about Aiza-san?
If I stop checking in... then I won't have a reason to see you anymore.
Kaori Miyazono
What do you want?
Look! Look! There's a plane in the sky! It's a night flight!
Amazing!
Huh?
Oh, hey, you're right.
What? You can see it, too?
Wow, the sky's connected, then, huh?
Huh? Is that all?
Yes. Something wrong?
The plane crosses the sea of stars.
Like a cat, you silently creep up to me.
You told me not to come to the hospital.
But I didn't say I wouldn't call you. It's flying really low, even though it's night.
She bombards me from an unexpected angle.
I'm dumbfounded, always following you.
I'll stop by again.
I told you, you don't have to. You know you don't have the time.
It's not about the time.
I want to see you.
A lump of steel, like a shooting star.
Just seeing the same sky as you makes familiar scenery look different.
I swing between hope and despair at your slightest gesture,
and my heart starts to play a melody.
What kind of feeling is this again?
What do they call this kind of feeling?
I think it's probably...
...called loved.
Is that a problem?
I'm sure this is what they call love.
I'm finally set.
Hey, good for you!
Well, it's a sports scholarship, so no surprises there.
They told me to report to the soccer team starting in March.
It's the bottom of the heap all over again. Gonna be tough.
Yeah, but still, who knew?
You hated it whenever I asked you to come with me to see her.
I was avoiding her.
Whenever I compare myself to Watari, I always get depressed.
You like Kao-chan, Kousei.
You're you.
Hey, Watari.
I really like Miyazono.
Stupid! I knew that.
Yeah.
Hey, so you're finally gonna duke it out with me, huh?
Get Dr. Katagiri!
Isn't that Kaori-chan's room?
Hang on! The doctor will be here soon, all right?
Ms. Miyazono, are you with me?
You'll get better in no time, okay?
Take a deep breath, Ms. Miyazono!
Please hurry, Doctor!
Ms. Miyazono! Ms. Miyazono!
Ms. Miyazono, look at me!
Ms. Miyazono!
Ms. Miyazono, look at me!
Ms. Miyazono, can you hear me?!
Ms. Miyazono!
What are you two doing?!
Ms. Miyazono! Stay with us!
We're treating her now!
Go home today!
Totsuhara University Hospital
Hello?! Hello?! Hello?!
Get me that X-ray. Check its blood type.
He was pretty much beyond saving when he got hit. I'm sorry, but...
Thank you very much.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Do you think you'll be able to forget?
You come, too!
Your hands are happy to be touching mine.
I'm glad it's you.

No way.
When I went to see her the other day, we talked like always.
"Let's go shopping for spring clothes..." That kind of stuff.
When Kousei and I got to the hospital...
Like, all of a sudden.
Kaori-chan's in the ICU right now.
She's gonna be okay, right? We can see her again, right?
I dunno. But it really doesn't look too good.
No...
You and Kousei?
So Kousei knows about this, too?

Dammit, Kousei!
I'm coming in!
Kousei!
What do you think you're doing? Do you understand the situation you're in?
You only have so many days before the competition!
Okay, we're going to practice! Get on your feet now!
I can't do this...
Can't do this... anymore...
Hiroko... Why does it have to end up this way?
All I... all I ever wanted was...
To play the piano, and make  my mother get well... that's all...
All I did...
was fall in love...
Why... does it have to end up this way?
I can't... go on.
No more...
I can't try anymore...

I want caneles.
Hey!
They let me come back to my room yesterday.
Oh, boy, what an ordeal. That was my first time ever inside an ICU.
You just can't relax in there, you know.
You really caught me at an awkward moment!
That's why I told you not to come to the hospital.
Hey!
Wh-What are you doing?
Don't come to see me and then  stand around looking so gloomy!
You're gonna make me even sicker! Oh...
Canele! I want to eat it outside!
It's too cold.
Not in this hospital room!
Come on, come on, come on!
One word about me being heavy, and I'll kick your butt, all right?
I think you could stand to eat more.
She's light... Very light.
At some level, I felt easy in my mind. That she was all right now.
That she was so strong, she could just send her illness packing.
That this "now" would go on forever.
She loves stuffed animals, and loves sweets.
Fragile. You're just a normal girl, and yet...
I'm a moron.
Wow...
Snow.
Are you playing the piano?
No, I'm not.
I knew it.
"You're feeling sorry for yourself."
...I can't do it anymore.
The people I care about keep leaving me.
The people I care about... music takes them away from me.
I'm going to be left all alone.
But you have me.
But you have me.
I'm going to have surgery, see.

On February 18.
I'm going to struggle as hard as I can.
Struggle, struggle, struggle, like there's no tomorrow.
It's your fault. It's all your fault, all of it.
The reason I'm putting up such an unseemly struggle,
why I'm so fixated on living... it's your fault.
You gave me this desire to cling to the time that I spend with you.
Aren't you going to struggle, too? We're so good at struggling!
We risk our lives to struggle, because we're musicians, remember?
But...
I haven't touched the piano for a week now. My fingers...
It was the same when you were my accompanist.
Back then, I was always playing the piano for my part-time job.
No way can I play decently now!
Being able to play in this state would be a miracle.
You're looking down again.
See?
Miracles can happen just like that!
You exist inside me, Kousei Arima.
You like egg sandwiches. You like Moo Moo Brand milk.
What else do you like? What are your favorite insects?
What kind of stuff did you collect? What anime shows did you like?
There's so much that I don't know.
I envy Tsubaki-chan for knowing everything.
I want to know so many things about you.
So...
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.
Don't leave me all alone!
I'm a moron.
She's ultra-violent. Her personality blows. She leaves the worst impression.
But...
She's beautiful.
You're so beautiful in the snow.

We're going to start the anesthesia, all right?
Now take a deep breath.
Listen, Doctor...
"We all need someone to kiss us goodbye."
...Marcie.
Her pulse is stable.
Anesthesia induction complete.
We're going to begin the surgery now.
Bravo!
Igawa-san!
You've won... You couldn't have played better, Emi!
All I can do is sigh.
Brother gave a great performance, too, but on another level, she didn't concede an inch!
I see... So this person is ahead of me on the path I want to follow.
That was splendid. I thought that Takeshi would be the runaway favorite, but there's no way to tell.
Artistic impression's all that separates them now...
You're certainly putting on the finishing touches. You damned witch.
This district is unbelievable.
There are actually two prodigies. Wonder which one's gonna win?
Oh, amateurs!
The greatest pianist of all has yet to play, you know.
Huh? Miike?
As always, so adept at fanning the flames of determination, that Ms. Ochiai.
Ms. Seto, how was he? Mr. Arima?
Oh, awful.
I brought him to the venue, but who knows if he can play decently.
He's reverted to that state from two years ago.
It's not even a matter of how he does in this competition anymore.
He might very well be finished as a pianist, too.
...me. Help me. Help me!
I'm at my wits' end...
Good job!
You were good!
Did you see that, Takeshi? Arima?
Hey, what's the matter?
You're not feeling well?
Want me to get you some medicine? I can bring you an antacid right away.
Isn't he just getting himself focused?
Huh? Oh...
Yeah, but still...
...play.
Gotta play, gotta play, gotta play.
Operation in Progress
Arima will be up soon.
Arima!
Arima will be coming.
Can't wait!
To hear the transformed genius!
No. 23, Kousei Arima.
You're going on soon. Please stand by in the wings.
H-Hey. Are you okay?
Yeah... I'm fine. I'm fine, all right?
You're fine? Your face couldn't be paler.
Anybody can see that you're not yourself.
Come on, let's go to the infirmary!
Sorry. But... I've got to play.
Because I'm a pianist.
Because I promised.
It's Arima!
It's Arima-kun!
There he is! It's Arima-san!
Dude's not gonna pass out or anything, is he?
I made you remember something you don't want to remember.
A violinist who can't hold her own bow... that's pointless.
I won't forget. I won't forget, even if I die.
I've got to play.
You can just forget about it all, like you've pressed the reset button.
I've got to play.
I guess maybe we never should've met, huh?
I've got to play. I've got to play.
Because... I'm a pianist.
Mr. Arima?
Kousei!
What's going on?
Is it the pressure?
It's getting to Arima?
You're looking down again.
Tsubaki, you dummy!
I don't know you! I don't know you!
Tsubaki... You're here...
I see.
Everybody's... watching me.
This isn't just pesante...
It sounds so deep, so unhurried.
Ah... What a remarkably rich sound...
Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23.
Like a whisper, like a show of affection, so gently...
The sound of Chopin's Ballade, emanating so sorrowfully.
You were thinking about a girl you like, right?
You bet I was.
For now, just play from your heart.
Inside my heart, it's all chaos.
What a cliche.
It's not all bad, you know.
Oh, come on. You've done nothing but play the piano.
Can't help that. I'm not good with words, remember?
Everybody's watching... The reason I'm here right now...
...is because I had you.
The people who played a part in my life. The people who made my life fuller.
I can't let them down.
Hey, we're musicians. So everything's gotta be expressed in music, right?
Yeah, Aiza.
You're absolutely right.
Even if we're sad, or a total mess, even if we've hit rock bottom, we've still got to play.
Do you think I can do it?
No worries, no worries.
We'll figure it out.
Because we rule!
Play. Play. That's who I am, how I'm going to live my life.
Because I'm a pianist.
Just like you...
I'm a musician, after all!
Amazing!
This is incredible... Mr. Arima!
Mr. Arima, your life... Mr. Arima, your music...
It's taken on all this color!
Kousei's performance is bursting with color.
Snow
Bursting... with such mournful color.

This is the sound that my mother gave me.
The sound that Watari made me notice.
The sound that Tsubaki found for me.
The sound that was born out of my battles with Aiza and Igawa-san.
The sound that Aiza-san and I created together.
The sound that Hiroko-san made me remember.
I'm so scared... I can't hear...
Somebody...
But you have me.
Yes.
It's just like you said. If I listen closely...
I'm overflowing with so many sounds.
I'm not alone.
From the moment that we meet someone else, none of us can ever be alone.
We're all connected.
Don't leave me all alone!
Dummy. You have me.

Sumitani Junior High
Yo!
Dear Kousei Arima.
It feels weird to be writing a letter to someone who was just with me a moment ago.
You're an awful person.
Laggard, slowpoke, dummy.
The first time I ever saw you was when I was five...
It was during the recital for the piano school I was going to back then.
The boy who appeared so awkwardly drove the audience to laughter
when he bumped his behind on the stool...
He sat before the piano that was too big for him,
and the moment he played that first note...
He became the object of my admiration.
Playing notes as colorful as a 24-color palette, the melody began to dance.
I did it!
Oops!
I was totally surprised when the kid next to me burst out crying.
And yet, you're going to quit playing the piano.
After influencing my life the way you did...
Opening Soon!
How awful is that?
Daddy! Mommy!
Hey, welcome home, Kaori!
Are you hungry?
Buy me a violin!
What?
I'm gonna quit piano and play the violin!
What's this all of a sudden?
I want Kousei to play the piano for me!
Awful! Slowpoke! Dummy!
When I found out that we were going to the same junior high, I was elated.
How could I find a way to talk to you?
Maybe I'll go buy sandwiches everyday?
But in the end, all I could do was watch you.
After all, you guys were all too tight.
There was no space for me to slip into.
Totsuhara University Hospital
I had surgery as a child, and then got treated regularly as an outpatient.
After I collapsed in seventh grade, I was in and out of the hospital, repeatedly.
I started spending more time in than out.
I was hardly ever in school by then.
I knew that I wasn't very well.
One night...
When I saw my mother and father crying in the hospital waiting room,
I realized that I didn't have much time.
That was the moment.
That I...
Broke into a run.
I started doing whatever I wanted, so I wouldn't bring my regrets with me to heaven.
Those contact lenses that scared the heck out of me.
Eating a whole cake, which I'd never done before because I worried about my weight.
Even the music scores that bossed me around so haughtily...
I played them my way.
And then...
I just told a single lie.
Kaori Miyazono likes Ryota Watari...
...that was the lie I told.
What?!
That lie...
Would bring before me...
Kousei Arima...
It brought you to me.
From: Keiko-chan What are you doing later? There's something I want to tell you.
Please tell Watari-kun that I'm sorry.
You two-timer!
Go to hell, you miserable cheater!
What's the big deal!? All I did was go out with some girl!
You should've gone with me the day before yesterday!
Well, but still.
I guess it won't take long for Watari-kun to forget all about me.
As a friend, he's a fun guy, but I'd rather have someone more intense.
Also...
Please tell Tsubaki-chan that I'm sorry.
I'm just someone who's passing through, who'll be gone.
I didn't want to leave an awkward mess behind, so I couldn't ask Tsubaki-chan.
Or rather, even if I asked her straight-up, "Please introduce me to Arima-kun,"
I don't think Tsubaki-chan would've been okay with that.
After all, Tsubaki-chan was so crazy about you.
We'd all known that for a long time.
The only ones who didn't know were you...
...and Tsubaki-chan.
Hey, Kashiwagi?
Huh?
Um... Go check on Kousei, will you?
Huh?
Ask him if he's eating right.
No way.
What? You're so heartless! So callous!
You're the heartless one. It's super-unnatural. Don't rely on me. Go yourself!
But Kousei... Now that Kao-chan...
Now that the person he was in love with is gone, I just know that he's feeling down.
I just don't know what I should do for him...
Dummy Tsubaki.
You're such a dummy, it wouldn't do any good to rack the brains that you don't even have!
Muscle-for-brains!
Don't you think that's a little too harsh?
I don't think it has to be anything special.
It's all right to just be yourself, I bet.
At times like these, you don't listen to your head...
...you listen to your heart.
Where'd you get that perspective on romance?
BL.
Nao Kashiwagi 15 years old Hasn't had a boyfriend yet Book Collection: 108
The "you" that my underhanded lie brought to me
wasn't who I'd imagined.
You were more negative and passive than I thought,
not to mention stubborn, relentless, and a camera voyeur.
Your voice was lower than I thought, and you were more manly than I thought.
And you were... just as gentle as I thought.
The river was so cold and felt so good when we jumped off Courage Bridge, wasn't it?
The round moon peeking into the music room looked like a delicious manju bun.
When we raced that train, I really thought that we could win.
It was fun singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star together under the shining stars, wasn't it?
There's just something about school at night, right?
Don't you think snow looks just like cherry blossom petals?
To be so consumed by everything off-stage when I'm a musician...
...that just doesn't make sense, does it?
Look how you've gotten more sensual. You've grown up, haven't you?
He's so cool!
N-N-N-Not like I want to be able to play just like Mr. Arima, all right?
What a cliche!
Isn't it funny how the most unforgettable scenes can be so trivial?
That's not true.
What about you?
Was I able to live inside someone's heart?
Yes, you were.
Was I able to live inside your heart?
You barged right in without taking off your shoes.
Do you think you'll remember me at least a little?
If I ever forgot you...
...you know you'd come back to haunt me.
You'd better not hit "reset!"
As if I ever would.
Don't forget me, okay?
Okay.
That's a promise, okay?
Okay.
I'm glad it's you, after all.
Will I reach you?
I hope I can reach you.
Kousei Arima...
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
Sorry I didn't finish all the caneles.
Sorry I hit you so much.
Sorry I was such a brat.
Sorry a million times over...
Thank you.
You're so selfish.
I'm the one who should be thanking you.
P.S. I'm enclosing something that I've always treasured.
If you don't want it, feel free to tear it up and throw it away.
Yo.
...Yo.
Uh... Um... Uh...
What do you think you're doing!?
Don't go thinking you can ever be alone, Kousei!
I'm gonna stay with you forever and ever, like your guardian angel!
Get used to it!
Spring will be here soon.
Spring, the season I met you, is coming.
A spring without you...
...is coming.
Your Lie in April
Thank You For Watching!
